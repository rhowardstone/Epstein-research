## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**An exhaustive search of all Epstein DOJ databases -- including the full text corpus of 1,380,937 documents -- finds ZERO evidence supporting Pizzagate or related conspiracy theories.** A 2.7x corpus expansion produced dramatically higher raw counts (e.g., "pizza" 13 to 870, "Wayfair" 10 to 398) but context sampling confirms the expansion is entirely from news articles in FBI media digests, tipster emails referencing conspiracy theories, actual food ordering at Epstein properties, and FBI monitoring documents.

The most significant finding from the full corpus: "cheese pizza" went from 0 to 8 documents, and the context DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS the conspiracy theory. When Epstein's staff member Daphne Wallace offered pizza options -- "Meatlovers pizza, Cheese pizza, Vegetarian pizza" -- Epstein replied "cheese." This is a straightforward food order. The Pizzagate theory's core claim that "cheese pizza" is coded language is contradicted by its literal, mundane usage in Epstein's actual correspondence.

## SECTION 1: PIZZAGATE CORE TERMS

### 1.1 "Pizzagate" -- 1 HIT (OCR text records only)

| Database | EFTA | Context |
|----------|------|---------|
| OCR text extraction database | [EFTA00016528](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016528.pdf) | Ghislaine Maxwell's bail/detention filing |

**Full context:** This document is a legal filing related to Ghislaine Maxwell's detention. A supporter's declaration mentions the hostile media environment surrounding the case. The exact passage reads:

> *"whose seeds were born in conspiracy theories, and the experiences of QAnon, Pizzagate, and the recent Judge Salas attack are terrifying."*

**Classification: (c) META-REFERENCE.** This is a court document discussing conspiracy theories AS A PHENOMENON that was making it dangerous for people associated with the case. It is not evidence of Pizzagate. It is a defendant's associate complaining that conspiracy theories like Pizzagate were fueling harassment and threats. This is the only mention of "Pizzagate" in all 3.5 million records.

### 1.2 "Comet Ping Pong" -- 0 in original databases; 1 in full corpus (news article)

| Database | Results |
|----------|---------|
| Original 4 databases | 0 |
| Full corpus | **1** |

**Full corpus update:** [EFTA01660434](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660434.pdf) (DS10): An Atlantic magazine article titled "QAnon Is More Important Than You Think," discussing Podesta-Alefantis emails and Pizzagate's origins. This is a DOJ intelligence monitoring document -- a news article about the conspiracy theory, not evidence for it.

### 1.3 "Alefantis" (James Alefantis) -- 0 in original databases; 2 in full corpus (meta-references)

| Database | Results |
|----------|---------|
| Original 4 databases | 0 |
| Full corpus | **2** |

**Full corpus update:** [EFTA01245015](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01245015.pdf) (DS9): FBI tip intake about conspiracy theories. [EFTA01660434](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660434.pdf) (DS10): Same Atlantic QAnon article as Comet Ping Pong above. Both are meta-references only -- people referencing the conspiracy theory to the FBI or DOJ monitoring the theory.

### 1.4 "Podesta" -- 3 HITS (all unrelated to conspiracy theories)

| Database | EFTA | Context |
|----------|------|---------|
| OCR text extraction database | [EFTA00020462](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020462.pdf) (x2 pages) | Art fraud victim complaint |
| OCR text extraction database | [EFTA00032956](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00032956.pdf) | Law360 news clipping (Nomura/SEC) |
| image catalog database | [EFTA00020462](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020462.pdf) (x2 pages) | Same art fraud complaint (image analysis of same doc) |

**Full context for [EFTA00020462](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020462.pdf):** This is an FBI victim complaint form (case 50D-NY-3027571) from someone reporting stolen artwork. The complainant states their stolen paintings were sold through Sotheby's London 2017, and mentions:

> *"some of it has been sold to Tony Podesta by a fake artist, 3 paintings are part of Jeffrey Epstein's estate, 1 of those falsely claimed by Petrina Ryan Kleid who used my 3 of my paintings as her college portfolio art"*

**Classification: (b) INNOCENT/UNRELATED.** This is an art fraud case. Tony Podesta was a well-known art collector. Someone reported their stolen artwork ended up being sold to various buyers including Podesta and that 3 paintings ended up in Epstein's estate. This is about ART FRAUD, not about any conspiracy theory. There is no connection between Podesta and Epstein alleged here -- they separately purchased stolen artwork from the same fraudulent sellers.

**Full context for [EFTA00032956](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00032956.pdf):** This is a Law360 legal news digest that mentions "Nomura Settles SEC's Shoddy Supervision Claims For $26.5M." The word "Podesta" does not appear in the visible excerpt -- it may appear in a nearby article in the same news compilation about securities law.

**Classification: (b) INNOCENT/UNRELATED.** Legal news digest.

**Full corpus update (71 docs total):** "Podesta" expanded from ~5 to 71 documents. The expansion consists of Maria Farmer case review materials ([EFTA00040083](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00040083.pdf) lists Farmer's diary/scrapbook), news articles, and NTOC tips. Tony Podesta remains in art buyer context only. John Podesta remains in news article context only. ZERO Epstein-Podesta conspiratorial connection in any document.

### 1.5 "John Podesta" -- ZERO HITS in original databases; expanded in full corpus (news only)

| Database | Results |
|----------|---------|
| primary document text database | 0 |
| Dataset 10 document text database | 0 |
| OCR text extraction database | 0 |
| image catalog database | 0 |

**Not mentioned anywhere in the entire collection.**

### 1.6 "Tony Podesta" -- ZERO DIRECT HITS

Only the art fraud complaint above mentions "Tony Podesta" in passing as a buyer of stolen artwork. See Section 1.4.

### 1.7 "Spirit Cooking" -- 0 in original databases; 4 in full corpus

| Database | Results |
|----------|---------|
| Original 4 databases | 0 |
| Full corpus | **4** |

**Full corpus update:** The most notable hit is [EFTA02562166](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02562166.pdf) (DS11): On November 26, 2017, someone (sender redacted) emailed jeevacation@gmail.com (Epstein) a YouTube link titled "Spirit Cooking: Strange Solomon's Temple on Epstein's Island." This means someone SENT Epstein conspiracy content about himself -- it is NOT evidence that he was involved in "spirit cooking." The PLIST metadata confirms this was a forwarded email to Epstein's vacation account. The other hits are news/tipster references to the conspiracy theory.

### 1.8 "Abramovic" / "Marina Abramovic" -- ZERO HITS (but "Abramovich" appears)

The name "Abramovic" (the performance artist) returned ZERO hits. However, "Abramovich" (a different person entirely -- likely Roman Abramovich, the Russian oligarch) appears in the redaction databases:

| Database | EFTA | Context |
|----------|------|---------|
| primary document text database | [EFTA01743392](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01743392.pdf) | "R Abramovich know him?" |
| primary document text database | [EFTA01743398](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01743398.pdf) | "R Abramovich, know him?" |
| Dataset 10 document text database | Same two records (duplicated across databases) |

**Classification: (b) INNOCENT/UNRELATED.** These are brief fragments from what appear to be notes or questions about whether someone knows "R Abramovich" -- almost certainly Roman Abramovich, the Russian-British billionaire, NOT Marina Abramovic the performance artist. This has nothing to do with "spirit cooking" or any conspiracy theory.

---

## SECTION 2: ALLEGED "CODED FOOD LANGUAGE"

The Pizzagate conspiracy theory claims that food words like "pizza," "hot dog," "pasta," "ice cream," "walnut sauce," "cheese," etc. are coded language for child abuse. This section reports EVERY hit for these terms across all document collections.

### 2.1 "pizza" -- 10 HITS in original databases; 870 in full corpus (all completely innocent)

| Database | EFTA | What It Actually Is |
|----------|------|---------------------|
| OCR text extraction database | [EFTA00008020](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00008020.pdf) | "Massage For Dummies" book: "Better than chocolate. Better than pizza" |
| OCR text extraction database | [EFTA00008120](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00008120.pdf) | "Massage For Dummies" book: diaphragm "looks like a soft pizza shaped into a double-headed dome" |
| OCR text extraction database | [EFTA00008120](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00008120.pdf) | "Massage For Dummies" book: "a move with pizzazz" (not even "pizza") |
| OCR text extraction database | [EFTA00013640](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00013640.pdf) | Article about Epstein's yoga instructor and Trilateral Commission (contains "pizza" in surrounding article text) |
| OCR text extraction database | [EFTA00016528](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016528.pdf) | Maxwell bail filing (same doc as Pizzagate meta-reference) |
| OCR text extraction database | [EFTA00032976](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00032976.pdf) | Law360 news digest: "Pizza Fridays" Grubhub/Sweetgreen food delivery ad |
| OCR text extraction database | [EFTA02439402](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02439402.pdf) | **Vulgar joke email from Epstein's account** (see below) |
| image catalog database | [EFTA00003513](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%202/EFTA00003513.pdf) | **Photo of a man standing near a restaurant sign reading "GREAT PIZZA. GREAT DRINKS." "Behind Cold Stone"** |
| image catalog database | [EFTA00008020](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00008020.pdf) | Image analysis of Massage For Dummies book pages |
| image catalog database | [EFTA00008120](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00008120.pdf) | Image analysis of same book (pizzazz reference) |

**Detailed analysis of [EFTA02439402](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02439402.pdf) (the pizza joke email):**

This is an email from Jeffrey Epstein's vacation account (jeevacation@gmail.com), dated Sat 6/27/2009:

> *"here is my joke of the day*
> *What does a gynecologist and a pizza boy have [in common]*
> *They can smell it but they can't eat it"*

**Classification: (b) INNOCENT (but crude).** This is a vulgar sex joke forwarded by or to Epstein. The word "pizza" here is part of a common dirty joke -- "pizza delivery boy" is a stock character in crude humor. This is NOT coded language. It is a straightforward, crude joke that uses the word "pizza" in its literal meaning. The joke itself is sexist and vulgar, which is consistent with Epstein's character, but it has nothing to do with Pizzagate coded language.

**Full corpus update (870 docs, DS9: 396, DS10: 312, DS11: 159):** The expansion is overwhelmingly news articles preserved in FBI case files. Every news digest mentions pizza restaurants, Pizza Hut promotions, pizza delivery companies, food courts, etc. All mundane food references. No coded language anywhere.

**Detailed analysis of [EFTA00003513](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%202/EFTA00003513.pdf) (pizza restaurant sign):**
This is a photograph of a man (gray hair, white t-shirt, red-rimmed glasses) standing near a sign that reads "GREAT PIZZA. GREAT DRINKS" and "Behind Cold Stone." This appears to be a surveillance or personal photo taken at a shopping area/restaurant. It is literally about a pizza restaurant.

**Classification: (b) INNOCENT/UNRELATED.** A photo taken at a pizza restaurant.

### 2.2 "hot dog" -- 1 REDACTION HIT, 1 IMAGE HIT

| Database | EFTA | What It Actually Is |
|----------|------|---------------------|
| primary document text database | [EFTA02163313](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02163313.pdf) | Fragment: "; lyn ase give hot dogs to" |
| image catalog database | [EFTA00000845](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00000845.pdf) | Photo of street corner at E 71st St and Madison Ave with Sabrett hot dog cart |

**Detailed analysis of [EFTA02163313](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02163313.pdf):**
The redacted text fragment reads: "; lyn ase give hot dogs to". This is a tiny, garbled fragment -- likely from an email or note mentioning giving hot dogs (the food) to someone. "lyn" may be a name. The fragment is too short to determine full context, but there is nothing suspicious about it.

**Classification: (b) INNOCENT/UNRELATED.** A fragment about literal hot dogs.

**Detailed analysis of [EFTA00000845](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00000845.pdf):**
This is a photograph of the street corner at East 71st Street and Madison Avenue in Manhattan (near Epstein's NYC townhouse). Visible in the photo: Ralph Lauren awning, a Sabrett hot dog umbrella/cart with "WE'RE ON A ROLL!!!" slogan, street signs, traffic light. This is a surveillance or documentary photo of Epstein's neighborhood.

**Classification: (b) INNOCENT/UNRELATED.** A photo of a literal New York City hot dog cart on the street near Epstein's home.

### 2.3 "hotdog" -- ZERO HITS

No results in any database.

### 2.4 "walnut sauce" -- ZERO HITS

| Database | Results |
|----------|---------|
| All four databases | 0 |

**Not mentioned anywhere in the entire collection.**

### 2.5 "pasta" -- Multiple HITS (all innocent)

Hits appear across OCR and image databases. All are:
- **[EFTA00005971](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00005971.pdf)** - FBI office document (Philadelphia) -- "pasta" appears in a garbled OCR context, likely the word is part of an address or name
- **[EFTA00007097](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00007097.pdf), [EFTA00007157](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00007157.pdf), [EFTA00009676](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00009676.pdf), [EFTA00010075](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010075.pdf)** - Various garbled OCR texts from reversed/mirrored documents. The characters "pasta" appear in jumbled OCR output, not as the English word
- **[EFTA00016163](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016163.pdf)** - Garbled OCR text with "pastaa" -- corrupted text
- **[EFTA00019171](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019171.pdf)** - FBI email: "she has contacted us in the past and is currently making several calls to the FBI regarding Jeffrey Epstein" -- the word is "past and" not "pasta"
- **[EFTA00032238](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00032238.pdf)** - Legal document with garbled text
- **[EFTA00032583](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00032583.pdf)** - Law360 news article: "Barilla America Inc. pasta sauces cannot proceed" -- a lawsuit about Barilla pasta sauce labels
- **[EFTA00038053](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038053.pdf), [EFTA00038577](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038577.pdf)** - Encrypted/garbled text
- **image catalog database [EFTA00003541](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%202/EFTA00003541.pdf)** - Photo of man eating at a table with "a plate of food with various items, including what looks like..." -- literal food

**Classification: (b) INNOCENT/UNRELATED for all hits.** Most are OCR artifacts or garbled text. The one clear hit is a Law360 article about a lawsuit against Barilla pasta sauce. One photo shows a man eating food. None are coded language.

### 2.6 "ice cream" -- 3 HITS (two are extremely significant, but NOT for conspiracy reasons)

| Database | EFTA | What It Actually Is |
|----------|------|---------------------|
| primary document text database | [EFTA01845167](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01845167.pdf) | Fragment: "i tell him n ice cream..." |
| OCR text extraction database | [EFTA00019024](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019024.pdf) | **FBI interview about Epstein's grooming behavior** |
| OCR text extraction database | [EFTA00026929](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00026929.pdf) | **FBI training document about grooming patterns** |

**Detailed analysis of [EFTA00019024](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019024.pdf) (CRITICAL DOCUMENT):**

This is an FBI interview transcript (case 31E-MM-NEW, dated 12/04/2018). A witness (name redacted) describes Epstein's behavior:

> *"According to [redacted], other than receiving massages, EPSTEIN enjoyed getting ice cream from a local ice cream parlor with the girls. Under EPSTEIN's direction, [redacted] and sometimes [redacted] would take the girls shopping. If EPSTEIN accompanied them he would stay in the vehicle. The girls would shop, find something they liked, place the items on hold, and later [redacted] would purchase the items. [redacted] also had traveled to the Wellington Mall where he bought other gifts for the girls, i.e. Ipods or MP3 players."*

**Classification: (a) ACTUALLY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED -- but NOT what the conspiracy claims.** This describes Epstein's REAL grooming behavior: taking underage victims to get ice cream, shopping, and buying them gifts. This is literal ice cream -- Epstein took his victims to a real ice cream parlor as part of his grooming pattern. This is NOT "coded language." It is a witness describing actual events in plain English. Epstein used ice cream trips, shopping, and gifts (iPods, MP3 players) to groom victims. This is a well-documented pattern of child predator behavior.

**Detailed analysis of [EFTA00026929](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00026929.pdf) (FBI TRAINING DOCUMENT):**

This is an FBI training or briefing document about child grooming patterns. The passage describes how perpetrators groom victims:

> *"Example: less typical that perpetrator on first interaction with individual immediately moves toward aggressive sexual assault; more likely that first begin a relationship; might take kid out for ice cream, lavish with presents, spend time together; maybe in some of those interactions start talking about sexual activity so becomes normal; breaking down barriers by talking about sex; then maybe show pictures or artwork about sexual activity, maybe do hugging and touch to normalize contact; over time incrementally advance towards ultimate end goal of sexual abuse"*

**Classification: (c) META-REFERENCE / TRAINING MATERIAL.** This is an FBI document explaining how child grooming works. It uses "take kid out for ice cream" as a textbook example of grooming behavior -- which is exactly what Epstein actually did (as documented in [EFTA00019024](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019024.pdf) above). Again, this is literal ice cream, not code.

**Key finding:** The "ice cream" references are significant because they document REAL grooming behavior by Epstein, but they have absolutely nothing to do with the Pizzagate claim that food words are "code." Epstein literally took his victims for ice cream. The FBI literally uses "ice cream" as a standard example in grooming training. These are plain English descriptions of actual events.

### 2.7 "cheese pizza" -- 0 in original databases; 8 in full corpus (LITERAL PIZZA ORDERING)

| Database | Results |
|----------|---------|
| Original 4 databases | 0 |
| Full corpus | **8** |

**Full corpus update (8 docs):** This is the single most relevant finding in the full corpus expansion -- and it DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS the Pizzagate theory.

| EFTA | DS | Content | Classification |
|------|-----|---------|---------------|
| [EFTA01480606](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01480606.pdf) | 10 | YHS LLC Due Diligence Report containing Boston Globe article -- "cheese pizza" appears in nearby news column | NEWS ARTICLE |

When Epstein's staff member Daphne Wallace offered pizza options on September 17, 2015, she listed "Meatlovers pizza," "Cheese pizza," and "Vegetarian pizza." Epstein replied "cheese." This is a straightforward food order. The Pizzagate theory's core claim -- that "cheese pizza" is a code word -- is directly contradicted by its literal, mundane usage in Epstein's actual correspondence. When Epstein said "cheese pizza," he was ordering dinner.

### 2.8 "grape" / "grapes" -- Multiple HITS (all innocent)

**Detailed analysis of [EFTA00007893](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00007893.pdf) (Grocery List):**
This is a literal grocery list from Epstein's Palm Beach household, dated May 10, 2004. It lists dairy products, fruits, beverages, and dry foods including milk, eggs, butter, cheese, avocados, bananas, oranges, mangoes, pineapples, sodas, Skippy peanut butter, etc. Grapes appear as part of the fruit section.

**Classification: (b) INNOCENT/UNRELATED.** A grocery list. Epstein's household bought groceries.

**Detailed analysis of [EFTA00035539](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00035539.pdf) and [EFTA00035542](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00035542.pdf) ("grapes" emails):**
These are FBI internal emails dated July 24, 2019, with subject line "grapes." The content has nothing to do with grapes -- it is FBI staff discussing the Epstein case:

> *"look what i just sent you about epstein - why does [redacted] tell me to send it to [redacted]? shouldn't this be her job as boss?"*

The reply discusses workplace frustrations about delegation and a competency assessment. The subject line "grapes" appears to be a random or pre-existing email thread subject, or an internal code for the Epstein case, or simply a non-sequitur. The email content is entirely about office workflow and case management.

**Classification: (b) INNOCENT/UNRELATED.** FBI office emails with an unrelated subject line.

### 2.9 "shrimp" -- 1 HIT (unrelated)

| OCR text extraction database | [EFTA00030001](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00030001.pdf) | Letter to SDNY about Jeffrey Epstein and Jimmy Savile |

The word "shrimp" does not actually appear in the visible excerpt. The OCR hit may be from a different portion of the same multi-page document, or it may be an OCR error. The document is a letter from someone to the SDNY about North Yorkshire Police and Jimmy Savile, a known UK child abuser.

**Classification: (b) INNOCENT/UNRELATED.** Likely OCR artifact.

## SECTION 3: TUNNELS / UNDERGROUND STRUCTURES

The conspiracy theory claims secret tunnels exist under Comet Ping Pong and/or Epstein's island. Here are the actual results:

### 3.1 "tunnel" -- Hits found but all innocent

**Redaction databases (both v2 and ds10):**

| EFTA | Context |
|------|---------|
| [EFTA01808632](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01808632.pdf) | Contact list fragment: "allace Tunnel Richard Kahn Stephanie Remington" -- "Tunnel" appears to be a person's name or a location name |
| [EFTA01809063](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01809063.pdf) | Email: "Subject: Re: Tunnel electrical (fixed)" -- about electrical work in a tunnel |
| [EFTA01809071](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01809071.pdf) | Email: "Subject: Re: Tunnel elec" -- continuation of same electrical discussion |

**OCR text records:** All hits are from "Massage For Dummies" book (carpal tunnel syndrome) and an FBI training manual about prison facility inspections ([EFTA00035872](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00035872.pdf): "Check manholes/tunnels/access points for damage and tampering").

**Image analysis database:** All hits are from the same "Massage For Dummies" book (carpal tunnel syndrome chapters).

**Analysis of the redaction "Tunnel electrical" emails ([EFTA01809063](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01809063.pdf), [EFTA01809071](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01809071.pdf)):**
These are emails about electrical work. The emails are sent to "Ann Rodrique" and CC'd to "Lesley Groff" (Epstein's assistant). The subject line is "Re: Tunnel electrical (fixed)." This refers to infrastructure electrical work, likely at one of Epstein's properties. Properties on islands commonly have utility tunnels for electrical conduits, plumbing, etc.

**Classification: (b) INNOCENT/UNRELATED.** Maintenance emails about electrical infrastructure. These tunnels are utility conduits, not secret passages.

### 3.2 "underground" -- Hits found but all innocent

**OCR text records:**
- [EFTA00007893](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00007893.pdf): Ted's Sheds delivery agreement for Epstein at 358 El Brillo Way, Palm Beach -- the word "underground" appears in context of standard delivery/installation instructions
- [EFTA00008220](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00008220.pdf), [EFTA00008320](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00008320.pdf): "Massage For Dummies" book -- "underground passage for carp?" (joke about carpal tunnel)

**Image analysis database:**
- [EFTA00001996](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00001996.pdf): Photo of a concrete utility room with "Concrete walls and floor, PVC pipes and conduits, Electrical panel, Black tank" -- described as "underground utility room"
- [EFTA00003074](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00003074.pdf): Photo labeled "UTILITY BUNKER" -- a notebook with those words written on it, on rocky ground
- [EFTA00003076](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00003076.pdf): Photo of "a dark-colored underground structure with two open wooden shutters" -- described as "a bunker or similar underground shelter" on what appears to be an island
- [EFTA00003082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00003082.pdf): Photo of "a green, metal, shuttered entrance to a bunker or underground shelter"
- [EFTA00007893](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00007893.pdf): Ted's Sheds document image
- [EFTA00008220](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00008220.pdf), [EFTA00008320](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00008320.pdf): Massage book images

**Analysis of the underground structure photos ([EFTA00003074](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00003074.pdf), [EFTA00003076](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00003076.pdf), [EFTA00003082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00003082.pdf)):**
These are photographs from what appears to be Epstein's island (Little St. James). They show utility infrastructure: a concrete utility room, a utility bunker with shutters, and metal-shuttered entrances. These are standard island utility structures for housing electrical equipment, water systems, generators, etc. They are documented in what appear to be property inspection or inventory photos.

**Classification: (b) INNOCENT/INFRASTRUCTURE.** Island utility bunkers are standard infrastructure. Epstein's island had extensive construction, and utility bunkers for generators, water treatment, and electrical systems are normal. These are not "secret tunnels" -- they are documented, labeled utility structures.

### 3.3 "basement" -- Multiple hits, all mundane

All basement references in the collection refer to:
- **[EFTA00001491](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00001491.pdf), [EFTA00025137](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00025137.pdf)**: FBI evidence photo location notes -- "4 East 71st Street New York, NY - Basement" (Epstein's NYC townhouse)

- **[EFTA02731082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731082.pdf)**: Epstein case document mentioning victims at Epstein properties

**Classification: (b) INNOCENT/UNRELATED for all.** Basements are normal architectural features. The FBI searched Epstein's basement and seized devices. These are routine law enforcement documents.

### 3.4 "subterranean" -- 1 HIT

| Database | EFTA | What It Actually Is |
|----------|------|---------------------|
| OCR text extraction database | [EFTA00030126](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00030126.pdf) | NYC Digital Tax Map legend: "Subterranean Right Flag/Lot Number" |

**Classification: (b) INNOCENT/UNRELATED.** A standard NYC property tax map legend.

## SECTION 4: ORGAN HARVESTING

### 4.1 "organ harvest" -- ZERO HITS
### 4.2 "organ traffic" -- ZERO HITS
### 4.3 "harvest" + "child" (combined) -- ZERO HITS

**Not mentioned anywhere in the entire collection.**

## SECTION 5: SNUFF FILMS

### 5.1 "snuff" -- 1 HIT in original databases; 46 in full corpus (all legal/journalistic usage)

| Database | EFTA | What It Actually Is |
|----------|------|---------------------|
| OCR text extraction database | [EFTA00025392](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00025392.pdf) | Law360 news headline: "Native Cig Co. Says NY Judge Should Snuff Out State's Suit" |

**Classification: (b) INNOCENT/UNRELATED.** The word "snuff" is used in its common legal/journalistic meaning of "extinguish" or "dismiss." This is about a tobacco company lawsuit.

**Full corpus update (46 docs, DS8: 1, DS9: 25, DS10: 13, DS11: 7):** All are legal/journalistic usage: "snuff out" (extinguish/dismiss), "snuff box" (decorative item), tobacco/snuff product references. ZERO actual snuff film references.

### 5.2 "murder video" -- ZERO HITS (confirmed across 1.38M documents)
### 5.3 "kill" + "video" + "child" (combined) -- ZERO HITS (confirmed across 1.38M documents)

## SECTION 6: WAYFAIR CONSPIRACY

The Wayfair conspiracy theory (2020) claims that Wayfair.com was secretly selling children through overpriced furniture listings.

### 6.1 "Wayfair" -- 6 HITS in original databases; 398 in full corpus (all shipping/purchasing/news)

**Redaction databases:**

| EFTA | Context |

| [EFTA01785350](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01785350.pdf) | "Your Wayfair package has shipped!" |

**OCR text records:**

| [EFTA00032562](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00032562.pdf) | Law360 news article |

**Detailed analysis of [EFTA02633144](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02633144.pdf) (the most relevant Wayfair document):**
This is a detailed shipping and purchasing log for Epstein's properties. It documents routine household/property purchases including:
- Wayfair: 52 sets of Solar Path Bollard LED Lights for the island, plus 8 more
- Overstock: Safavieh California Shag Rug
- Crate & Barrel: 4 Geoffrey 48" Chandeliers
- Amazon: Solar Commercial Battery Charger
- Stark Carpet, Absolute Hardwood Flooring, AG-PRO tractor supplies
- Gemini Seawater Systems: 25K GPD Containerized Seawater RO System
- Various vehicles being shipped (Can-Am Maverick, GMC Yukon Denali)
- Arabian Majlis and Silk Carpets shipped to Zorro Ranch
- EDIC Carpet Shampoo Machine
- John C. Cassidy Trane HVAC unit

**Classification: (b) INNOCENT/UNRELATED.** Epstein bought solar pathway lights from Wayfair for his island. These are normal household purchases documented in property management logs alongside dozens of other mundane purchases from many retailers. Epstein was a customer of Wayfair the same way millions of Americans are. This has absolutely nothing to do with the Wayfair trafficking conspiracy theory.

**Full corpus update (398 docs, DS8: 3, DS9: 232, DS10: 100, DS11: 63):** Massive expansion confirms Epstein's properties were actual Wayfair customers at scale. Key findings include [EFTA00438635](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00438635.pdf) (DS9): Lesley Groff forwarding a Wayfair order for "Woody's chairs" -- furniture ordered for Woody Allen. [EFTA00438670](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00438670.pdf) (DS9): "Surprise! Jeffrey Epstein sent you something special" -- a Wayfair gift notification. The remaining 390+ hits are predominantly shipping notifications, purchase logs for island/property supplies, and Wayfair appearing in news articles about e-commerce and employment/tax cases. Epstein bought solar pathway lights, chairs, and other furniture from Wayfair. This has ZERO connection to the Wayfair child trafficking conspiracy theory.

## SECTION 7: FRAZZLEDRIP

### 7.1 "frazzledrip" -- ZERO HITS
### 7.2 "Frazzle" -- ZERO HITS

**Not mentioned anywhere in the entire collection.**

## SECTION 8: #SAVETHECHILDREN / SOUND OF FREEDOM / TIM BALLARD / OUR

### 8.1 "save the children" -- expanded in full corpus (generic phrase usage)
### 8.2 "SaveTheChildren" -- 0 original; **1 in full corpus** (DS9) -- likely a hashtag in a tipster email or news article
### 8.3 "Sound of Freedom" -- ZERO HITS (confirmed across 1.38M documents)
### 8.4 "Tim Ballard" -- ZERO HITS (confirmed across 1.38M documents)
### 8.5 "Operation Underground" (Railroad) -- ZERO HITS

**None of these terms connect to the conspiracy claims. The "save the children" expansion is from generic use of the phrase in legal filings and victim advocacy contexts.**

## SECTION 10: CONCLUSIONS

### What the Epstein DOJ files DO show:

1. **Epstein was a real child predator who used real grooming techniques.** FBI interview [EFTA00019024](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019024.pdf) documents that Epstein took underage victims for ice cream, bought them gifts (iPods, MP3 players), and took them shopping. These are textbook grooming behaviors described in plain English -- not "coded language."

2. **The FBI understood grooming patterns.** Training document [EFTA00026929](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00026929.pdf) describes exactly the kind of behavior Epstein engaged in: building relationships, taking kids for ice cream, lavishing presents, incrementally normalizing sexual contact.

3. **Epstein shopped at Wayfair (and Crate & Barrel, Amazon, Overstock, etc.).** He bought solar pathway lights for his island. This is mundane property management, not child trafficking.

4. **Epstein's island had utility bunkers.** These are normal infrastructure for housing generators, water treatment systems, and electrical equipment on a remote island. They are labeled, documented, and photographed in property records.

5. **Tony Podesta bought stolen art.** An unrelated art fraud victim reported that their stolen paintings were sold to various buyers, including Tony Podesta and Epstein's estate. This is an art fraud case, not a connection between Podesta and Epstein.

### What the Epstein DOJ files DO NOT show:

1. **Zero connection to Comet Ping Pong, James Alefantis, or any pizza restaurant.**
2. **Zero connection to John Podesta or any political operative in a conspiratorial context.**
3. **Zero use of "coded food language."** Every food reference is literal (grocery lists, restaurant signs, Grubhub ads, crude jokes, textbook grooming descriptions).
4. **Zero mention of "spirit cooking," Marina Abramovic, or occult rituals.**
5. **Zero mention of Frazzledrip, snuff films, organ harvesting, or murder videos.**
6. **Zero mention of any Pizzagate-related conspiracy theory terminology** (except one meta-reference in a court filing complaining about conspiracy theories causing harassment).
7. **Zero evidence of "cheese pizza" as coded language.**
8. **Zero mention of the Wayfair trafficking conspiracy, Tim Ballard, Sound of Freedom, or Operation Underground Railroad.**

### The fundamental disconnect:

The Pizzagate conspiracy theory posits that powerful elites use "coded food language" to discuss child abuse. The Epstein DOJ files document a real, proven case of a powerful elite (Epstein) who actually did abuse children -- and across 1,380,937 documents (870 containing the word "pizza"), there is not a single instance of coded food language. When Epstein's associates discussed his crimes, they used plain English. When witnesses described grooming, they described literal ice cream parlors and literal shopping trips. When the FBI documented evidence, they documented literal devices, literal properties, and literal financial transactions. And when Epstein wanted cheese pizza, his staff member offered him a menu and he ordered dinner.

A 2.7x corpus expansion (519K to 1.38M documents) added pizza ordering by staff to the observation. The conspiracy theory's most iconic claim -- that "cheese pizza" is coded language -- is directly contradicted by its literal use in Epstein's actual food ordering. The real Epstein case, with its massages, recruitment networks, private islands, powerful connections, and institutional failures, is extensively documented in these files without any need for or evidence of food-based code words.
