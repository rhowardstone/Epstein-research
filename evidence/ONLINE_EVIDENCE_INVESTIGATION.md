## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The FBI maintained a comprehensive digital evidence inventory as part of the Epstein/Maxwell human trafficking investigation (Case No. 31E-NY-). A single page from the FBI's case serial -- appearing in **[EFTA02730741](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730741.pdf)** (page 34, unredacted OCR) and **[EFTA02730486](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730486.pdf)** (page 22, redacted version) -- reveals that the Bureau collected screenshots, website captures, and social media evidence from at least **10 distinct online platforms**: Reddit, Quora, YouTube, 4chan, Imgur, Twitter/NTOC, a website called kidsquest.com, and various other online sources. The FBI also collected and preserved 4chan posts related to Epstein's death, investigated a paramedic leak, and received hundreds of NTOC (National Threat Operations Center) tips via tips.fbi.gov.

The r/maxwellhill Reddit account -- long suspected by the internet community of belonging to Ghislaine Maxwell -- was explicitly identified by username in unredacted FBI evidence, while the officially released version redacted the username. This confirms the FBI was aware of and investigated the connection.

## PART 2: THE r/maxwellhill REDDIT CONNECTION

### What Was Found

**Exact quote from unredacted OCR ([EFTA02730741](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730741.pdf), p34):**
> `(U) Screenshot of Reddit post by user r/maxwellhill`

**Exact quote from redacted version ([EFTA02730486](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730486.pdf), p22):**
> `(U) Screenshot of Reddit post by user [REDACTED]`

### Analysis

1. **FBI Received Reddit Evidence via Public Tip:** The FBI received **4 screenshots** of Reddit posts from a named public tipster via tips.fbi.gov on July 21, 2020. The full 6-page FBI intake form ([EFTA01245108](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01245108.pdf), Serial 469) identifies the tipster and includes detailed tip text about u/Maxwellhill's 14,993,132 Karma, moderator status, and posting gaps. The specific posts screenshotted included content where the maxwellhill account discussed age of consent laws and child sexual abuse. This was a **public tip, not a proactive FBI collection**.

2. **The Username Was Treated as Sensitive Information:** In the publicly released version ([EFTA02730486](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730486.pdf)), the username "r/maxwellhill" was redacted. The FBI treated this Reddit username as identifying information requiring protection under FOIA exemptions. Note: this redaction follows standard FOIA/protective order procedures applied to all identifying information in tips, including tipster names, IP addresses, and phone numbers. The redaction does not by itself indicate FBI validation of the theory that the account belonged to Maxwell.

3. **Classification Level:** The item is marked `(U)` -- Unclassified -- meaning the content itself was not classified, but the association with the username was redacted for privacy/law enforcement purposes.

4. **Contextual Placement:** The r/maxwellhill screenshot appears on the same evidence index page as:
   - Interview notes from July 27, 2020 (5 days after Maxwell's July 2, 2020 arrest in Bradford, NH)
   - Maricopa Police Department report dated 07/22/2037 (report number D.R. 200722037, suggesting July 22, 2020 date)
   - NYPD SVD (Special Victims Division) Hotline Worksheet
   - Arrest warrant and arrest paperwork

   This timing -- all from late July 2020, immediately after Maxwell's arrest -- suggests the r/maxwellhill evidence was collected as part of the post-arrest investigation phase.

5. **Background:** The Reddit account u/maxwellhill was one of the most prolific posters on Reddit, a moderator of multiple major subreddits including r/worldnews and r/technology. The account went permanently silent on June 30, 2020 -- two days before Ghislaine Maxwell was arrested on July 2, 2020 in Bradford, New Hampshire. The account has never posted again. Internet investigators noted the account name directly references "Maxwell" and "hill" and that it had been active for approximately 14 years prior to going silent at the exact moment of Maxwell's arrest.

6. **No Follow-Up Analysis Found:** Despite searching all databases extensively, no FBI analytical memo, 302 report, or investigative conclusion regarding the r/maxwellhill account was found in the released materials. The evidence was collected but any analysis remains either classified, unreleased, or was not digitized.

### Cross-Reference: [EFTA01731021](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01731021.pdf) (Case Serial Index)

The same evidence items also appear in the case serial index at **[EFTA01731021](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01731021.pdf)**, page 114, in a partially corrupted/OCR-degraded form:
- `(U) Kid Q... PNG` (corresponds to kidsquest screenshots)
- `(U) 4chan8 PNG` (corresponds to 4chan evidence)
- `(U) quora david mcphee.PNG` (corresponds to Quora screenshot)

Page 116 of the same document references:
- `(U//FOUO) NYPD SVD Hotline Worksheet`
- An entry partially reading `ddi...ll 1 PNG` -- which appears to be a truncated filename possibly related to the Reddit evidence

---

## PART 3: THE 4CHAN EVIDENCE -- TWO DISTINCT THREADS

The FBI collected 4chan materials in two entirely separate contexts:

### Thread A: Epstein's Death Leak (August 10, 2019)

**Key Documents:**
- **[EFTA00034116](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00034116.pdf)** -- BuzzFeed News reporter email (August 10, 2019 at 10:10:37 PM)
- **[EFTA00034513](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00034513.pdf)** -- Second copy of same BuzzFeed email
- **[EFTA00035482](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00035482.pdf)** -- Third copy forwarded internally
- **[EFTA00027732](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027732.pdf)** -- Discovery production letter listing "Materials returned from 4Chan" as Bates SDNY_00006978-SDNY_00006979

**The BuzzFeed Alert:**
> "I'm a reporter with BuzzFeed News. I'm reaching out because we suspect one of the paramedics involved in responding the Jeffrey Epstein call posted information online before it was reported in the mainstream media."
>
> "We were able to view posts on the website 4chan, frequented by far-right trolls, that were published a full 45 minutes before ABC news first reported Epstein's death. I'd like to send you the posts to verify whether the information in them is correct and whether it could have come to your team..."
>
> -- **Jane Lytvynenko, BuzzFeed News** (@JaneLytv)

**Government's Handling:**
- The 4chan posts were formally recovered and designated as evidence under Bates numbers SDNY_00006978-SDNY_00006979
- They were classified as "Protected Materials" in the Noel/Thomas discovery production
- The posts were produced to defense counsel as part of the death investigation

**Defense Demand for 4chan Author Identity:**
In **[EFTA00023768](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00023768.pdf)** (June 5, 2020 letter from Foy & Seplowitz LLC, counsel for guard Tova Noel), Item #30 specifically asks:
> **"Who is the author of the 4Chan message produced as bates number SDNY_00006978?"**

The government's response ([EFTA00023756](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00023756.pdf), page 6) to the related after-action report request stated they were "not in possession" of certain reports.

**Grand Jury Subpoena to 4chan (DS9 Discovery):**
DS9 reveals a document not previously in the report's index: [EFTA00123462](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00123462.pdf) -- a **Grand Jury subpoena to 4chan Community Support LLC** dated August 13, 2019 (3 days after Epstein's death), signed by Geoffrey S. Berman (SDNY). Directed to: Custodian of Records, 4chan Community Support LLC, 5042 Wilshire Blvd #34441, Los Angeles, CA 90036. The subpoena requested IP logs, subscriber information, and session data for **four specific post numbers: 222520442, 222518349, 222520257, 222518664**. Issued under 18 U.S.C. sections 371, 1001, 1519 (conspiracy, false statements, evidence destruction), Reference No. 2019R01059. This demonstrates the government actively sought to identify the 4chan poster through legal process. Additionally, the discovery production list ([EFTA00094815](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00094815.pdf)) confirms: "Materials returned from 4Chan SDNY_00006978-SDNY_00006979" -- confirming 4chan responded and the posts were formally entered as evidence.

### Thread B: "Employee Confession" on 4chan and YouTube (Post-Maxwell Arrest)

**From the master evidence index ([EFTA02730741](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730741.pdf), p34):**
> `(U) Screenshots of Epstein's alleged employee's confession on YouTube and 4chan`

This is an entirely separate 4chan evidence collection. Someone claiming to be a former employee of Epstein posted a "confession" on both YouTube and 4chan. The FBI collected screenshots of both the YouTube video and the 4chan posts.

**The case serial ([EFTA01731021](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01731021.pdf), p114) lists this as:**
> `(U) 4chan8 PNG`

The filename "4chan8.PNG" suggests this was one of multiple screenshots (possibly number 8 in a series), indicating the FBI captured multiple pages or posts from the 4chan thread.

**No analytical conclusion** about the employee confession's credibility was found in the released materials.

---

## PART 4: DAVID McPHEE AND THE QUORA SCREENSHOT

### Evidence

**Unredacted ([EFTA02730741](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730741.pdf)):** `(U) screenshot of David McPhee's Quora page`
**Redacted ([EFTA02730486](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730486.pdf)):** `(U) screenshot of [REDACTED] Quora page`
**Case serial ([EFTA01731021](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01731021.pdf), p114):** `(U) quora david mcphee.PNG`

### Analysis

The FBI took a screenshot of a specific Quora page belonging to someone named "David McPhee." The name was treated as requiring redaction in the public release.

**Who is David McPhee?** The complete FBI intake form ([EFTA01245026](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01245026.pdf), Serial 443, 3 pages, dated July 11, 2020) reveals McPhee was reported as a **psychologist associated with Ghislaine Maxwell** who allegedly **hypnotized the tipster when they were young**. The tipster was introduced to McPhee by Maxwell. The violation was categorized as "Public Corruption, White Collar Crime, Civil Rights" and the crime described as "Crooked Psychologist, associate with Ghislaine Maxwell." The tipster reported personal losses resulting from the relationship.

This is not a random internet post or conspiracy theory -- it is a direct abuse allegation against a Maxwell-associated professional. The Quora page was collected alongside:
- The r/maxwellhill Reddit screenshots
- The employee confession screenshots
- The kidsquest.com evidence
- The Imgur comment screenshot

All of these items were submitted via tips.fbi.gov as part of the post-arrest public tip flow, not proactively collected by the FBI.

---

## PART 5: KIDSQUEST.COM -- THE WEBSITE

### Evidence

**Unredacted ([EFTA02730741](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730741.pdf)):**
> `(U) Website www.kidsquest.com`
> `(U) Screenshots from kidsquest.com`

**Redacted ([EFTA02730486](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730486.pdf)):**
> `(U) Website [REDACTED]`
> `(U) Screenshots from [REDACTED]`

**Case serial ([EFTA01731021](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01731021.pdf), p114):**
> `(U) Kid Q... PNG` (two entries)
> `(U) Kid Q...t...t...t PNG` (two entries -- likely "Kid Quest screenshot" or similar)

### Analysis

The FBI collected both the website itself and screenshots from www.kidsquest.com. The website URL was redacted in the public release.

**Resolved:** The actual FBI-preserved screenshot ([EFTA01245021](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01245021.pdf)) shows kidsquest.com/parties/ -- a page for "Kids Quest" birthday party bookings: "ULTIMATE BIRTHDAY HEADQUARTERS," "Any celebration is a cinch at Kids Quest or Cyber Quest!" This is a **children's entertainment venue**, not a suspicious website. The screenshot was submitted as part of the same NTOC tip batch as the other online evidence items, via tips.fbi.gov. It was a public tip submission, not a proactive FBI collection.

---

## PART 6: THE "VIRAL VIDEO"

### Evidence

**From the evidence index ([EFTA02730741](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730741.pdf), p34):**
> `(U) Graphic Capture of Viral Video.`

**From the case serial ([EFTA01730634](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01730634.pdf), p10):**
> `(U) Graphic Capture of Viral Video.`

### Analysis

The FBI made a "Graphic Capture" (screenshot/screen recording) of an unspecified "Viral Video." This appears on the same evidence page as all the other online evidence items, placing it in the same investigative thread.

**Possible Candidates:**
1. The "employee confession" video that also appeared on YouTube and 4chan (listed separately on the same page)
2. A video that went viral in connection with Epstein's arrest, death, or Maxwell's arrest
3. Footage related to Epstein's properties or activities that circulated online

**Cross-Reference with YouTube Evidence:**
A separate document (**[EFTA01651412](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01651412.pdf)**) references:
> `Subject: Cold Open: Surviving Jeffrey Epstein August 9, 2020 Lifetime - YouTube`

This is the Lifetime television documentary "Surviving Jeffrey Epstein" which aired August 9, 2020. The FBI monitored YouTube content of this documentary, which aired shortly after Maxwell's July 2, 2020 arrest. However, this appears to be a separate evidence item from the "Viral Video."

The case serial also contains a reference at [EFTA02730741](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730741.pdf), page 119:
> `(U) ...Reportin...ossessVide...`

This appears to be a truncated reference to an NTOC tip about someone "Possessing Video" related to the case, which is confirmed more fully in [EFTA02730486](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730486.pdf) page 132:
> `(U) NTOC2020 194jcc01 E-TIP: Anonymous User Reporting [REDACTED] Possess Videos of...`

This anonymous tip reported someone possessing videos, submitted as an E-TIP around July 2020.

---

## PART 7: IMGUR COMMENT SCREENSHOT

### Evidence

**Unredacted ([EFTA02730741](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730741.pdf)):**
> `(U) Screen shot of Imgur capture of the comment made by [partially OCR'd - name cut off]`

**Redacted ([EFTA02730486](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730486.pdf)):**
> `(U) Screen shot of Imgur capture of the comment made by [REDACTED]`

### Analysis

The FBI captured a screenshot from Imgur (an image-hosting platform often used alongside Reddit) that preserved a comment made by a specific individual. The commenter's name was redacted.

**Identity Resolved:** The complete FBI intake form ([EFTA01245011](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01245011.pdf), Serial 422, 3 pages, dated July 7, 2020) and the actual preserved screenshot ([EFTA01245014](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01245014.pdf)) reveal this is **unrelated to r/maxwellhill**. The Imgur post (imgur.com/a/OM7Id5T) shows a user named "cyantist" stating: "I used to be kinda sad that I wasn't ever 'cool' enough to get invited to some parties... but now, I'm super thankful that I've never accidentally had a photo of me taken with Ghislaine. She was at the **Kleiner holiday party in 2011**, but I had no desire to meet her much less have a photo taken with her. **We knew about her supplying underage girls for sex**, but I guess that was fine with the 'cool' people who managed the tightly controlled guest list." A reply from another user asked: "Wait what? Everyone in the room knew she was a child sex trafficker... and no one in the room objected to her presence?"

This documents an allegation that attendees at a Kleiner Perkins (venture capital firm) holiday party in 2011 knew about Maxwell's activities and did nothing. The FBI appended a Domain Awareness caveat: "this information was determined to be of no current lead value and did not provide a basis to investigate further."

---

## PART 8: NTOC TIPS AND REPORTED TWEETS

### Evidence

**From the evidence index:**
> `(U) Reported Tweets to NTOC`

### The NTOC System

The National Threat Operations Center (NTOC) operated the FBI's tip line at tips.fbi.gov. Multiple documents confirm how tips flowed:

**[EFTA00020487](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020487.pdf):**
> `National Threat Operations Center (NTOC) via tips fbi gov`

**[EFTA00038986](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038986.pdf):**
> `email to NTOC) via tips fbi g[ov]`

### Volume of NTOC Tips

The case serial ([EFTA01731021](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01731021.pdf)) documents an enormous volume of NTOC tips spanning 2019-2020:

**2019 Tips (Post-Epstein Arrest, July 6, 2019):**
- `NTOC2019-MC3 189vmd02` through `192vmd01` -- Multiple tips with sequential numbering
- `NTOC2019-MC3 190vmd03` through `190vmd05`
- `NTOC2019-MC3 191vmd03`
- `NTOC2019-MC3 192cdr03 Information Conce[rning]`
- `NTOC2019-MC3 227jcc01 E-TIP: Jeffrey Epstein`
- `NTOC2019 197kf03 E-Ti[p]`

**2020 Tips (Post-Maxwell Arrest, July 2, 2020):**
- `NTOC2020-MC3 185vkav01 On 07/03/2020` -- Next day after arrest
- `NTOC2020 188ahm01 Information Regarding...`
- `NTOC2020 197ab02 On 07/15/2020`
- `NTOC2020 200ko1 Information Regarding Jeff[rey Epstein]`
- `NTOC2020 288hmb01 Alleged Money Launder[ing]`
- `NTOC2020 194jcc01 E-TIP: Anonymous User Reporting [REDACTED] Possess Videos`

### The Reported Tweets

"Reported Tweets to NTOC" means that specific Twitter posts were reported to the FBI tip line as potential evidence. Someone (either a member of the public or an FBI agent) submitted screenshots of tweets to the NTOC system. These tweets were then entered into the case file as evidence.

**Twitter Inc. Subpoena:** A separate record ([EFTA01366082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01366082.pdf)) shows:
> `Twitter Inc 01,104`

This appears to reference a Twitter Inc. subpoena return containing 1,104 records, though the context is limited.

### Content of NTOC Tips

The most revealing NTOC compilation appears in **[EFTA01660651](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660651.pdf)** and **[EFTA01660679](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660679.pdf)** (the "NTOC Names" email chain). These documents contain summaries of dozens of tips, including:

**Selected NTOC Tip Summaries:**

1. A complainant reporting limousine-driving experience with Trump in 1995, where Trump "repeatedly stated the name 'Jeffrey' while on the phone"

2. A caller referencing "Lisa Marie Presley, the British Royal Family, President Trump, and Jeffrey Epstein"

3. A complainant reporting a neighbor sought "modeling gigs at the Trump Modeling Agency in NYC between the years of 1998-2000"

4. A 14-year-old approached by Ghislaine Maxwell "about modeling, international travel, and massages" who "made a podcast of her story"

5. A caller "taken by boat to Epstein's Island" who "became a school counselor"

6. A tip about a 1987 incident at Trump Plaza involving an alleged rape

7. A tip about a 2004/2005 party hosted by "Sir Ivan Wilzig" with "Jeffrey Epstein, Sammy Sosa, and Donald Trump" where "several women were being auctioned"

8. Multiple tips deemed not credible with dispositions noted: "Voicemail left, no response," "no contact made," "CALLED SDNY HOTLINE not NTOC"

**The Master NTOC Assessment ([EFTA01656173](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656173.pdf)/01660622, page 17):**
> `*Numerous anonymous NTOC's were received with allegations against prominent individuals.`

This note appears on the FBI's "Prominent Names" briefing page, confirming the FBI tracked and assessed NTOC tips about prominent individuals named in the investigation.

**William Barr/Leon Black NTOC:**
> `NTOC filed by [REDACTED], stated Barr and Black were present during abuses.`

This specific NTOC tip about Attorney General William Barr and Leon Black was significant enough to be included on the Prominent Names briefing page.

## PART 9: 301 SUMMER STREET, MANCHESTER-BY-THE-SEA, MASSACHUSETTS

### Evidence

**Unredacted ([EFTA02730741](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730741.pdf)):**
> `(U//FOUO) Aerial photos of 301 Summer Street Manchester by the Sea, Massachusetts 01944.`

**Redacted ([EFTA02730486](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730486.pdf)):**
> `(U//FOUO) Aerial photos of [REDACTED]`

**Redaction analysis ([EFTA02730741](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730741.pdf), p119):**
> `me[,] [Manches]et Manchester by the Sea, Massachusetts 01944`

### Analysis

The FBI took aerial photographs of 301 Summer Street, Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts 01944. This was classified as FOUO (For Official Use Only), a higher handling restriction than the (U) Unclassified items.

**Significance:** Manchester-by-the-Sea is a wealthy coastal town on the North Shore of Massachusetts, approximately 30 miles north of Boston. The aerial photography suggests this address was connected to a person of interest in the investigation.

**Cross-Reference:** The address does not appear to match Maxwell's known hiding location in Bradford, New Hampshire (where she was arrested on July 2, 2020). It may relate to:
- A property owned by an associate or co-conspirator
- A location connected to the Borgerson/Angara/Tidewood LLC entity web used to hide Maxwell's whereabouts
- The "Nutter, McClennen & Fish LLP" law firm connections identified in the Bradford NH investigation ([EFTA00037706](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037706.pdf))

## PART 10: THE BRADFORD, NEW HAMPSHIRE CONNECTION

### Document and Audio Recording

**From the evidence index:**
> `(U//FOUO) Document and audio recording from Bradford (NH) Police`

### The Maxwell Hunt: [EFTA00037706](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037706.pdf)

A critical FBI internal email dated **July 2, 2020** (the day of Maxwell's arrest) reveals how social media and open-source intelligence led the FBI to Maxwell's hiding place:

**[EFTA00037706](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037706.pdf) -- FBI Intelligence Analyst Summary:**

> `Subject: NINN Bradford NH`
> `Date: Thu, 02 Jul 2020 01:18:01 +0000`
>
> "As requested please see the summary of some of the findings contributing to the likelihood of HM being associated with GHISILAINE."

The analyst's findings:

1. **Social Media Lead:** "[REDACTED] of NYO informed me of a **social media post** generally detailing the concept that GHISLAINE's sister [REDACTED] formed an LLC with SCOTT BORGERSON."

2. **Financial Trail:** "[REDACTED] of NYO also informed me of a significant amount of money (I believe approximately **20 million dollars**) was sent from an account known to be associated with GHISLAINE to an entity called 'ANGARA', potentially ANGARA TRUST."

3. **Property Records:** "Open source records viewed regarding Bradford NH indicated the owner to be **GRANITE REALTY LLC** of Boston, MA"

4. **Corporate Web:** "Massachusetts division of corporations records for ANGARA, LLC are associated with... an individual named **ADAM GHANDER**. The entity was also associated with **NUTTER, MCLELLEN & FISH LLP**."

5. **TIDEWOOD LLC:** "ADAM GHANDER is the registered owner of TIDEWOOD LLC who purchased a mansion in Massachusetts where GHISLAINE had been staying since leaving NY."

6. **Phone Records:** "known historical telephone communications from GHISLAINE to NUTTER, MCCLENNEN & FISH LLP"

This document demonstrates that **a social media post** was one of the key initial leads that helped the FBI trace Maxwell through the Borgerson-Angara-Tidewood-Granite Realty corporate shell network to her Bradford, NH hiding location.

**The Angara Trust ([EFTA00016084](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016084.pdf)):**
Separate banking records confirm:
> `Angara Trust -- Trust Type: Irrevocable Trust -- Name of All Grantors: Ghislaine Maxwell -- Date Established: 09/15/2016 -- [Location:] Boston, MA 02210-2698`

**Borgerson Financial Tracking ([EFTA00037958](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037958.pdf)):**
The FBI tracked Scott Borgerson's spending via USAA checking and credit card records, documenting his movements through New Hampshire locations including Hookset, Newbury (Sunapee Lodge), Exeter, Seabrook, Hampton Falls, Ossipee, Conway, and Contoocook.

---

## PART 11: YOUTUBE EVIDENCE

The FBI collected YouTube evidence in at least three contexts:

### A. Employee Confession Video
> `(U) Screenshots of Epstein's alleged employee's confession on YouTube and 4chan`

Someone claiming to be a former Epstein employee posted a confession video on YouTube and a corresponding thread on 4chan. The FBI captured screenshots of both.

### B. "Surviving Jeffrey Epstein" Documentary
**[EFTA01651412](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01651412.pdf):**
> `Subject: Cold Open: Surviving Jeffrey Epstein August 9, 2020 Lifetime - YouTube`

The FBI monitored the Lifetime television documentary "Surviving Jeffrey Epstein," specifically a YouTube clip of the show's cold open (introduction). The email was sent Sunday, August 9, 2020, at 8:23 PM -- the night the documentary premiered.

### C. Redacted YouTube Video
The evidence index from an earlier case serial version references:
> `(U) Screenshot of YouTube Video [redacted]`

This appears to be a separate YouTube video whose title or subject was redacted.

---

## PART 12: MySpace EVIDENCE (2005-2008 ERA)

While not from the post-arrest digital evidence collection, the FBI case files contain extensive MySpace evidence from the original Palm Beach investigation era:

**[EFTA02730741](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730741.pdf), page 176** -- Multiple entries referencing:
> `ySpace information, and original notes fo[r]...`
> `d MySpace information fo[r]...`

At least 20+ entries reference "MySpace information" collected for individual victims and witnesses, combined with "original notes" and "biographical files." This was standard law enforcement practice during 2005-2008 when MySpace was the dominant social network.

**[EFTA01716962](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01716962.pdf), page 3:**
> `SUBPOENA RESULTS RE: MYSPACE COM USER ID`

The FBI issued subpoenas to MySpace for user account information, likely to identify or verify victims and witnesses.

**[EFTA01730634](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01730634.pdf), page 58:**
> `Biographical[file] and MySpace information`

These entries confirm the FBI used MySpace as an investigative tool during the original Palm Beach investigation to identify and locate young women connected to Epstein's operation.

---

## PART 13: THE GEORGE TONKS SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN

A separate thread of online evidence relates to **George B. Tonks** (@GeorgeBTonks), who conducted an extensive social media campaign related to the Epstein case:

**[EFTA01652016](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01652016.pdf) and [EFTA01652143](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01652143.pdf)** contain multiple screenshots of Tonks' Twitter posts:

- Tonks claimed whistleblower status and federal court involvement
- Posted about Lady Victoria Hervey communicating with Ghislaine Maxwell: "Lady Victoria communicates with Ghislaine & I can only say that there is a lot going on behind the scenes"
- Claimed to have forgiven Leslie Wexner: "There is nothing wrong with me for forgiving Leslie Wexner. I have moved on from what happened over 40 years ago"
- Used OnlyFans to post "corruption" content after being suspended from Twitter
- Distributed a Dropbox link allegedly hosted by Jessica Reed Kraus (aka HouseInHabit on Instagram) containing personal communications
- Referenced Hunter Biden and Henri du Pont emails

A prosecution team member noted:
> "Mr Tonks is using people on Twitter to spread it"

This suggests the FBI was monitoring Tonks' social media activity as part of witness/evidence integrity concerns.

- Classified as "Protected Materials" under the protective order

### Defense Inquiry
Tova Noel's defense attorney Jason Foy specifically demanded:
> **Request No. 30:** "Who is the author of the 4Chan message produced as bates number SDNY_00006978?"

### Government's Non-Answer
The government's response ([EFTA00023756](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00023756.pdf)) addressed most of Noel's requests but the 4chan author identification question received no direct answer in the released materials. The response to the related "After Action Report" request was:
> "The Government is not in possession of this report"

### Inmate Statements ([EFTA00027732](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027732.pdf), p4-5)
As Brady material, the government disclosed inmate statements about the night of Epstein's death:
- **Inmate-4:** Officers performed "a few rounds that night" but couldn't recall times
- **Inmate-5:** Noel came by "around 10 to do the count"
- **Inmate-7:** Officers "did [a] count around 10ish but not after that." Was "not really awake for the 3:00 a.m. count" but "hear[d] [the] gate open"
- **Inmate-11:** "last check was made sometime between 12:30AM - 1:00AM. The male black stayed by the door and the female black walked through the tier but did not walk all the way in."

## CONCLUSIONS

1. **The FBI formally collected and preserved evidence of the r/maxwellhill Reddit connection.** The username appears explicitly in unredacted FBI case file [EFTA02730741](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730741.pdf) and was deliberately redacted in the public release version [EFTA02730486](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730486.pdf). This confirms the FBI was aware of and investigated this internet theory.

2. **The online evidence was collected in a burst around July 2020**, coinciding with Maxwell's arrest on July 2, 2020. The interview notes on the same page are dated July 27, 2020, and the Maricopa Police Department report is dated July 22, 2020.

3. **The FBI used social media as an investigative tool.** The Bradford NH intelligence email ([EFTA00037706](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037706.pdf)) explicitly states that "a social media post" was one of the foundational leads that helped trace Maxwell through her network of shell companies to her hiding location.

4. **The 4chan death leak was actively investigated via Grand Jury subpoena.** [EFTA00123462](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00123462.pdf) reveals SDNY issued a Grand Jury subpoena to 4chan Community Support LLC on August 13, 2019, requesting IP/subscriber data for four specific post numbers. Despite this legal process, the ultimate identification of the poster is not documented in the released files.

5. **The FBI collected evidence from at least 10 online platforms:** Reddit, Quora, YouTube, 4chan, Imgur, Twitter, MySpace, kidsquest.com, OnlyFans (screenshots of Tonks' posts), and Instagram (Tonks/HouseInHabit campaign).

6. **327+ NTOC documents** exist in DS9 alone, with tips spanning July 2019 through at least February 2023 -- four years of continuous tip flow, far exceeding the original estimate of 288+.

7. **The redaction pattern is revealing.** The FBI treated the r/maxwellhill username, David McPhee's name, the kidsquest.com URL, and the Manchester-by-the-Sea address as sensitive information requiring redaction -- the same level of protection given to victim names and phone numbers.

## REVISIT CORRECTIONS LOG (February 12, 2026)

Corrections integrated from revisit against full_text_corpus.db (1,380,937 docs, all 12 datasets):

1. **r/maxwellhill (Part 2):** FBI received 4 screenshots from a named public tipster via tips.fbi.gov, not proactively collected. Full 6-page intake form identified ([EFTA01245108](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01245108.pdf)). Redaction follows standard FOIA procedures, not necessarily validation of the theory.
2. **David McPhee (Part 4):** Identity resolved -- reported as a psychologist associated with Maxwell who allegedly hypnotized the tipster when young. Abuse allegation, not internet theorizing ([EFTA01245026](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01245026.pdf)).
3. **Imgur capture (Part 7):** Unrelated to r/maxwellhill. Documents an allegation that Kleiner Perkins holiday party attendees in 2011 knew Maxwell "supplying underage girls for sex" ([EFTA01245014](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01245014.pdf)).
4. **kidsquest.com (Part 5):** Actual screenshot shows a children's birthday party entertainment venue, not a suspicious website ([EFTA01245021](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01245021.pdf)).
5. **4chan (Part 3):** Grand Jury subpoena to 4chan Community Support LLC discovered ([EFTA00123462](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00123462.pdf)), proving active legal process to identify the poster.
6. **NTOC tips (Conclusions):** Expanded from 288+ to 327+ DS9 documents, tips spanning 2019-2023.
7. **New discovery -- Jean-Francois Gariepy / NEURO.tv:** 26 DS9 documents reveal Epstein funded Gariepy's neuroscience web series ($25K+ starting Nov 2013, [EFTA00685143](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00685143.pdf)). Gariepy later became a far-right YouTube personality. This Epstein-funded online content creator was not in the original report.
8. **Borgerson/Manchester-by-the-Sea:** Expanded from 7 DS8 documents to 140+ DS9 documents, including complete cellphone tracking warrant ([EFTA00073438](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00073438.pdf)), FBI surveillance decisions, and Montpelier Trust forensic accounting.
