# The St. Barths Christmas 2010 Guest List

## Peggy Siegal's Social Directory and Its Connections to Jeffrey Epstein

*Based on EFTA02010594 and cross-referenced against 2.73 million pages of the DOJ EFTA production*

---

## Executive Summary

In December 2010, **Peggy Siegal** — the New York film publicist who functioned as Jeffrey Epstein's primary social intelligence conduit — compiled a detailed guest list and contact sheet for the St. Barths Christmas social season. The document, addressed to **Harvey Weinstein** ("Here is the list I just send Harvey"), catalogues 43 individuals and couples with their phone numbers, arrival dates, and accommodations across the island's yachts, villas, and luxury hotels.

The list reads as a directory of the ultra-wealthy social circuit that orbited Epstein's network in the years following his 2008 conviction. Cross-referencing all 43 entries against the full EFTA corpus reveals that the guest list names collectively appear in over **40,000 pages** of Epstein-related documents, with connections ranging from direct email correspondence and scheduled meetings to social overlap through shared intermediaries.

Most striking: **Ghislaine Maxwell** is listed as "Staying on Billy Kotick's boat" — almost certainly **Bobby Kotick**, then-CEO of Activision Blizzard, who appears in 116 pages of the corpus and had documented dinners at Epstein's home.

## The Document

**EFTA02010594** (Dataset 10) is a 5-page email from Peggy Siegal, sent Tuesday, December 21, 2010 at 11:23 PM, with the subject line "Fw: St. Barths." It exists in at least four copies across the corpus:

| EFTA | Dataset | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| EFTA02010594 | 10 | Primary copy |
| EFTA01830988 | 10 | Duplicate |
| EFTA01792909 | 10 | Duplicate |
| EFTA00900412 | 9 | DS9 copy |

The email opens:

> *"Here is the list I just send Harvey. Peg"*
>
> *"How many people are with you tomorrow? Do you know Samantha and Aby? Steve Cohen next door to Aby (just met him) and Larry Gogo next to Isle de France. Keep me posted. Peg"*
>
> *"Please look this over. I think Roman's boat is bigger than Ron Perelman's. Here is a list of everyone I know that's coming down so far. Please advise where and when to screen."*

The reference to screening suggests Siegal was arranging a private film screening on the island — consistent with her role as a film publicist.

## The Complete Guest List

The following table reproduces all 43 entries from the document, with each name cross-referenced against the full EFTA corpus.

### Tier 1: Deep Corpus Presence (1,000+ pages)

These individuals have extensive documentation in the Epstein files, indicating sustained relationships or significance to the investigation.

#### Ghislaine Maxwell — 29,177 pages / 11,845 documents

**Guest list entry:** *"24. Ghislaine Maxwell — a. Staying on Billy Kotick's boat"*

The single largest named presence in the EFTA corpus after Epstein himself. Maxwell's role in Epstein's operations is extensively documented across all datasets and is the subject of numerous other investigations. Her presence on this guest list — staying on Bobby Kotick's yacht — connects the St. Barths social scene directly to Epstein's inner circle.

#### Peggy Siegal — 8,094 pages / 7,076 documents

**Guest list entry:** *"38. Peggy Siegal — a. Dec 20th-Jan 3rd — b. Hotel Taiwana"*

Siegal compiled this list and was its author. Her 8,094-page footprint in the corpus consists overwhelmingly of direct emails to and from Epstein's `jeevacation@gmail.com` address. She functioned as Epstein's eyes and ears in the entertainment and art worlds — sending Hollywood gossip, event invitations, social dispatches from parties (Oscars, Cannes, St. Barths), and detailed biographical profiles of wealthy individuals she wanted to introduce to Epstein.

She is the single most important connector in this document. Nearly every name on this list appears somewhere in her emails to Epstein.

*See also: [Reuben Brothers / Siren / Chernoy](REUBEN_BROTHERS_SIREN_CHERNOY.md) for her role in the David Reuben introduction.*

---

### Tier 2: Significant Corpus Presence (100-999 pages)

These individuals appear in substantial documentation, often including direct correspondence or active scheduling by Epstein's staff.

#### David Geffen — 655 pages / 532 documents

**Guest list entry:** *"18. David Geffen — a. On Roman's boat"*

Geffen's page count is partially inflated by the "David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA" appearing in email signatures throughout the corpus. However, genuine personal references include event invitations forwarded to Epstein (particularly the PBS documentary premiere *Inventing David Geffen* in 2012) and a notable email from **Boris Nikolic** to Epstein: *"Bill is having a small dinner with just David Geffen and me"* — placing Geffen at an intimate dinner with Bill Gates in Epstein's correspondence.

Listed as traveling on Roman Abramovich's yacht for St. Barths.

#### Harvey Weinstein — 634 pages / 520 documents

**Guest list entry:** *"42. Georgina Chapman / Harvey Weinstein — a. Dec 24th on boat"*

Weinstein's corpus presence is mixed: news clippings and legal newsletters mentioning his case alongside other prosecutions; iMessage threads where Epstein associates discuss Weinstein's legal troubles (*"Harvey can't handle that he is going away for 20 years"*); and Peggy Siegal's emails casually referencing him (*"the list I just send Harvey"*). The St. Barths guest list was explicitly compiled for Weinstein.

No substantial direct Weinstein-Epstein email correspondence was found in the sampled documents, though the list itself demonstrates Siegal served as a social bridge between the two.

#### Martha Stewart — 281 pages / 266 documents

**Guest list entry:** *"39. Martha Stewart — a. Dec 23rd — c. John Pigozzi's boat"*

Stewart's corpus presence indicates active social contact. Epstein's assistant tracked her travel schedule: *"Martha Stewart on St. Croix Dec 23-Jan 2"* (EFTA01941259). Epstein asked associates about her attorney preferences: *"ask Martha Stewart's asst if they like the attorney Seiller"* (EFTA01754261). He also forwarded a 2019 NYT article about Stewart advising cannabis companies (EFTA02633143). Listed as staying on Jean Pigozzi's boat.

#### Jean Pigozzi — 242 pages / 229 documents

**Guest list entry:** *"32. Jean Pigozzi — a. Dec 23rd — b. Staying on his boat"*

A significant finding. Pigozzi — the Italian-French businessman, art collector, and heir to the Simca automobile fortune — maintained **direct email correspondence** with Epstein. He signed emails from his iPad as "Johnny" with casual, familiar language: *"Love woody, see you in Paris"* (EFTA01754806). He appears on **Edge Foundation** science dinner email lists alongside Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Sergey Brin, and Elon Musk.

Peggy Siegal referred to him as "Johnny Pigozzi" and placed him at Naomi Campbell's birthday celebration. His boat hosted both Martha Stewart and Brett Ratner during the St. Barths season.

#### Tamara Mellon — 211 pages / 128 documents

**Guest list entry:** *"26. Tamara Mellon — a. Dec 18th-Jan 3rd — b. At Isle de France"*

The Jimmy Choo co-founder appears in the corpus through Peggy Siegal's social emails and as a co-host of events: she hosted a dinner with Siegal for Alexandra Kotur at her home at 3 East 95th Street, Manhattan (EFTA02189185). Marketing emails from Tamara Mellon's fashion brand were sent to Epstein's `jeevacation@gmail.com` address (EFTA01928062), indicating he was on her commercial mailing list.

#### Larry Gagosian — 180 pages / 165 documents

**Guest list entry:** *"17. Shala Monroque / Larry Gagosian — a. House next to Isle de France"*

The mega-gallery owner appears almost exclusively through Peggy Siegal's dispatches: *"went to Larry Gagosian's dinner after Richard Prince show"* (EFTA01763702). Siegal nicknamed him "Larry Gogo" in her emails to Epstein. His assistant's contact card was in Epstein's files (EFTA01424667). No direct Gagosian-Epstein correspondence was found.

#### Bobby Kotick — 116 pages / 113 documents

**Guest list entry:** *"24. Ghislaine Maxwell — a. Staying on Billy Kotick's boat"*

Kotick does not have his own entry on the guest list — he is referenced only as the owner of the boat on which Ghislaine Maxwell was staying. The list uses "Billy Kotick," almost certainly a nickname or error for **Bobby Kotick**, then-CEO of Activision Blizzard.

The corpus documents a direct social relationship between Kotick and Epstein:
- *"Bobby Kotick came over last night, he's great"* — Epstein to Faith Kates, November 2012 (EFTA01975322)
- Epstein's assistant Lesley Groff arranged Kotick's attendance at a "Woody dinner" (EFTA02706315)
- Epstein described Kotick as a resource: *"I will ask friends, Bobby Kotick from Activision, for example"* (EFTA02007441)

The connection between Maxwell staying on Kotick's boat and Kotick's documented dinners at Epstein's home warrants further examination.

---

### Tier 3: Moderate Corpus Presence (20-99 pages)

#### Steve Cohen — 125 pages / 122 documents

**Not on the guest list itself** — but named in Siegal's cover email: *"Steve Cohen next door to Aby (just met him)."*

The hedge fund billionaire has a significant and diverse corpus presence. Epstein was actively interested in Cohen's insider trading prosecution: he emailed about *"the prosecution of Steve Cohen, they charged him with money laundering"* (July 2013) and asked about potential penalties. Beyond the legal case, Cohen appears in art market correspondence — estate administrator Richard Kahn discussed a Giacometti sculpture with Cohen via Gagosian gallery (2017) — and in real estate news forwarded to Epstein about Cohen cutting his NYC apartment price by 60%.

#### Aby Rosen — 117 pages / 106 documents

**Guest list entry:** *"3. Samantha Boardman / Aby Rosen — a. Have a house next to Isle de France"*

The German-American real estate developer had a **direct, active relationship** with Epstein. Epstein's assistant Lesley Groff emailed Rosen's office to schedule meetings in NYC (January-February 2011). Epstein's calendar entries show "Aby Rosen's office" as a meeting location. Siegal discussed Rosen in social-planning emails: *"Larry only eats with collectors...Aby Rosen and Samantha are cool."* Real estate news was forwarded to Epstein: *"Prime Minister of Qatar snaps up Aby Rosen's UES party mansion for $47 million."* Attorney Terry Kafka asked Epstein in January 2014: *"Do you know Aby Rosen?"*

#### Jane Rosenthal — 87 pages / 82 documents

**Guest list entry:** *"37. Jane Rosenthal / Craig Hatkoff — a. On a boat"*

The co-founder of the Tribeca Film Festival has a substantial corpus presence. Most hits relate to TFF VIP correspondence arranging Epstein's festival attendance and badges. She co-hosted a Whitney Museum book launch (November 2011) alongside other guest list names. In December 2012, Siegal wrote that she was *"calling Jane Rosenthal/Craig Hatkoff for contacts for their accountants"* — on Epstein's behalf.

#### Peter Brant — 87 pages / 74 documents

**Guest list entry:** *"6. Stephanie Seymour / Peter Brant"*

The newsprint magnate and art collector appears in Peggy Siegal's Palm Beach social emails and party/event guest lists. His wife, supermodel Stephanie Seymour (38 pages), is typically co-listed. Referenced in Siegal's St. Barths New Year's dispatch alongside Gagosian and Geffen.

#### Brett Ratner — 81 pages / 75 documents

**Guest list entry:** *"34. Brett Ratner — a. John Pigozzi's boat"*

The film director appears through Siegal's Cannes dispatches: *"Sitting next to Brett Ratner...he produced Woody's 3 hour documentary...Brett says hi and he loves you!"* (EFTA02014566). Epstein's assistant attempted to reach Ratner by phone in December 2010: *"The number we have for Brett's assistant is not a good number"* (EFTA01832187) — timed to the St. Barths season. Listed as staying on Jean Pigozzi's boat.

#### Nicolas Berggruen — 60 pages / 60 documents

**Guest list entry:** *"5. Nicolas Berggruen — a. Dec 23rd-Jan 2nd — b. At Larry Gagosian's"*

The billionaire investor and Berggruen Institute founder appears on event invitations and participant lists for Berggruen Institute "Dialog" retreats sent to Epstein's circle. Also appears on DS11 HTML-format event invitation lists alongside Ben Affleck, Sean Penn, and others.

#### Roman Abramovich — 53 pages / 47 documents

**Guest list entry:** *"1. Dasha Zhukova / Roman Abramovich — a. On their boat"*

The Russian-Israeli oligarch is listed first on the guest list, with his then-partner Dasha Zhukova. Mentioned in passing in Siegal's social emails — *"went to Dasha Zhukova and Roman Abramovich's"* New Year's party. One hit in a Peter Thiel email thread about meeting Dasha Zhukova (EFTA01989151). No direct Abramovich-Epstein correspondence found. His yacht was large enough that Siegal noted: *"I think Roman's boat is bigger than Ron Perelman's."*

#### Woody Johnson — 53 pages / 47 documents

**Guest list entry:** *"19. Suzanne / Woody Johnson — a. Dec 22nd — b. Staying at Isle de France"*

The New York Jets owner and later U.S. Ambassador to the UK appears on Siegal's event invite lists alongside Jared Kushner, Michael Bloomberg, and Donald Trump (e.g., NY Observer 25th Anniversary). Most notably, a Ghislaine Maxwell chat log contains: **"Woody Johnson ambassador to London. Wife, my old assistant."** — indicating Maxwell had a prior employment or personal assistant relationship with Woody Johnson's wife. Also appears on dinner/party guest lists compiled by Siegal for Epstein events.

#### Samantha Boardman — 48 pages / 30 documents

**Guest list entry:** *"3. Samantha Boardman / Aby Rosen — a. Have a house next to Isle de France"*

The psychiatrist and socialite (married to Aby Rosen) appears in Siegal's St. Barths email: *"Do you know Samantha and Aby?"* More significantly, she appears in a **2002 New York Post "Page Six" article** titled "MURKY WORLD OF CLINTON PAL" — the article that contains the famous Trump quote about Epstein: *"He likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side."* The article lists Boardman alongside Epstein, Clinton, and Trump.

#### Vivi Nevo — 44 pages / 43 documents

**Guest list entry:** *"31. Vivi Nevo — a. On his own boat"*

The Israeli-American billionaire venture capitalist. An iMessage thread (EFTA01620869) captures someone asking Epstein: *"Do you know Vivi Nevo?"* Epstein's reply was dismissive: **"Peripheral...big hat no cattle."** Two other email threads reference Nevo in connection with a Mykonos trip. His boat also hosted the Pinaults (entry #33).

#### Lorne Michaels — 41 pages / 40 documents

**Guest list entry:** *"28. Alice / Lorne Michaels — a. Dec 20th — b. Rented a home — c. Lorne's blackberry # (best way to reach him)"*

The *Saturday Night Live* creator appears on the guest list with detailed contact information, suggesting Siegal considered him reachable for social coordination. Also referenced in a music pitch where Mark Tramo mentions sending a song *"to Lorne Michaels for Andy Samberg and Lonely Island"* (EFTA02152808). No direct Michaels-Epstein correspondence found.

#### Stephanie Seymour — 38 pages / 38 documents

**Guest list entry:** *"6. Stephanie Seymour / Peter Brant"*

The supermodel appears in Siegal's New Year's 2011 emails, Tribeca Film Festival VIP correspondence arranging Epstein's attendance, and Siegal's Cannes 2014 dispatches: *"Walking red carpet with the family and Stephanie Seymour."*

#### Bob Colacello — 29 pages / 26 documents

**Guest list entry:** *"10. Bob Colacello — a. Dec 26th — b. Staying at Aby Rosen's"*

The Vanity Fair contributing editor and Warhol biographer appears on guest lists and in Siegal's social-coordination emails. His accommodation at Aby Rosen's further connects the Rosen social hub.

#### Jimmy Buffett — 25 pages / 25 documents

**Guest list entry:** *"4. Janie / Jimmy Buffett — a. Dec 23rd"*

Incidental mentions only — forwarded newsletters, song lyric quotes, and a QAnon article from The Atlantic. No direct Epstein connection.

#### François-Henri Pinault — 25 pages / 25 documents

**Guest list entry:** *"33. Selma Hayek Pinault / François-Henri Pinault — a. Vivi Nevo's boat"*

The luxury goods billionaire (Kering/Gucci) appears on guest lists and in Siegal's holiday correspondence. Traveling on Vivi Nevo's boat with wife Salma Hayek. Minimal substantive content.

#### George Economou — 24 pages / 12 documents

**Guest list entry:** *"20. Angela Ismailos / George Economou — a. Dec 24th — b. They have a home there"*

The Greek shipping magnate appears on guest lists and in a separate DS8 tipster letter discussing financial conspiracy theories about Apollo, Epstein, and short-selling schemes. The DS8 material is third-party speculation, not Epstein's own communications.

#### Patrick Demarchelier — 23 pages / 23 documents

**Guest list entry:** *"11. Mia / Patrick Demarchelier — a. Dec 15th-Jan 15th — b. He has a home there"*

The fashion photographer's most notable corpus appearance is in email threads between **Jean Luc Brunel** and Jeffrey Epstein, where Brunel writes about traveling *"with Patrick Demarchelier and Russian Vogue to St. Petersburg"* (April 2012). Brunel was a convicted Epstein associate who died in custody in 2022. The Brunel-Demarchelier travel connection appears in multiple forwarded versions of that email chain.

#### Rob Weisenthal — 23 pages / 23 documents

**Guest list entry:** *"41. Paige Nelson / Rob Weisenthal — a. Dec 22nd — b. Isle de France"*

The former CFO of Sony Pictures appears on guest lists and in Siegal's emails about event access disputes: she complained about calling *"Rob Weisenthal, CFO of Sony"* regarding screening logistics (June 2012).

#### Ron Perelman — 22 pages / 22 documents

**Guest list entry:** *"27. Kelly / Ron Meyer — a. On Ron Perelman's boat"*

The Revlon billionaire is referenced only through his boat — Ron Meyer (then-Vice Chairman of NBCUniversal) was staying on Perelman's yacht. Siegal compared yacht sizes: *"I think Roman's boat is bigger than Ron Perelman's."* Minimal direct corpus presence.

### Tier 4: Minor Corpus Presence (< 20 pages)

These individuals appear primarily or exclusively on the guest list documents, with limited independent content.

| # | Name(s) | Pages | Docs | Notes |
|---|---------|------:|-----:|-------|
| 25 | Benny Medina | 19 | 19 | Guest lists + event invitation lists (LWP event with Ben Affleck, Sean Penn) |

| 43 | Jimmy Tisch | 1 | 1 | Single guest list mention |

### Not Yet Searched

The following names were not independently searched due to common-name ambiguity or lack of independent context. They appear only on the guest list:

| # | Name(s) | Guest List Notes |
|---|---------|-----------------|
| 7 | Christiane Celle / Antoine Verglas | Has a house in St. Barths |
| 9 | Jim Coleman / Caitlin Fowler | House between Taiwana and Isle de France |
| 12 | Joanne / Roberto de Guardiola, Jr. | On their boat, Audacia |
| 14 | Shirin von Wulffen / Frederic Fekkai | Staying with friends on a boat |
| 15 | Erin Featherston / Sam Bassett | |
| 40 | Sarah / Izak Senbahar | Dec 19th-Jan 3rd |

*Note: Frederic Fekkai appears in 1,538 pages of the corpus — but almost entirely as credit card charges and salon appointments at his 5th Avenue hair salon, where Epstein's staff regularly booked services.*

---

## The Yacht Network

One of the most striking features of the guest list is how many guests were staying on yachts rather than at hotels or villas. The boats formed a floating social network anchored off St. Barths:

| Yacht / Host | Guests Aboard |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Roman Abramovich's yacht** | Dasha Zhukova, David Geffen |
| **"Billy Kotick's" boat** | **Ghislaine Maxwell** |
| **Jean Pigozzi's boat** | Martha Stewart, Brett Ratner |
| **Vivi Nevo's boat** | Selma Hayek Pinault / François-Henri Pinault |
| **Ron Perelman's boat** | Kelly / Ron Meyer |
| **David Reuben's Siren (242ft)** | Debra Reuben |
| **Roberto de Guardiola's Audacia** | Joanne de Guardiola |
| **Charles Cohen's boat** | Clo Cohen |
| Jane Rosenthal / Craig Hatkoff | On a boat (unspecified) |
| Harvey Weinstein / Georgina Chapman | On a boat (unspecified) |
| Susan Hess / John Hess | Arriving on a boat |

At least 11 of the 43 entries were yacht-based, creating a floating village of the ultra-wealthy. Ghislaine Maxwell — Epstein's most documented associate — was aboard Bobby Kotick's vessel, while David Geffen shared Roman Abramovich's yacht.

## Peggy Siegal: The Social Intelligence Network

This document is a product of Peggy Siegal's role as a social fixer and information broker. Several patterns emerge:

1. **Comprehensive intelligence gathering**: Siegal collected phone numbers, arrival dates, accommodation details, and social connections for all 43 entries — the kind of granular logistics usually handled by event planners or personal assistants.

2. **Dual audience**: The email was explicitly sent to Harvey Weinstein ("the list I just send Harvey") and reached Epstein's files. Siegal served as a bridge between both men's social networks.

3. **Film screening logistics**: The reference to "Please advise where and when to screen" indicates Siegal was arranging private film screenings — her professional function — using the guest list to assess the audience.

4. **Real-time social mapping**: Siegal tracked who was near whom ("Steve Cohen next door to Aby"), which boats were biggest ("I think Roman's boat is bigger than Ron Perelman's"), and who already knew each other — creating a navigable social map for her clients.

5. **Ongoing reporting**: Over the following days, Siegal sent Epstein dispatches from the island, reporting on parties she attended, meals she shared, and people she encountered — including lunch on the Reubens' yacht Siren and attendance at Abramovich's New Year's Eve party.

---

## Notable Connections and Patterns

### Maxwell on Kotick's Boat

Ghislaine Maxwell's accommodation on Bobby Kotick's yacht is notable because:
- Kotick had documented dinners at Epstein's home (November 2012)
- Epstein described Kotick as a friend and resource
- Maxwell was Epstein's primary associate and co-conspirator
- The boat arrangement suggests a pre-existing Kotick-Maxwell social relationship

### The Abramovich Orbit

Roman Abramovich's yacht functioned as a social hub, hosting both Abramovich's partner Dasha Zhukova and David Geffen. A separate email in the corpus shows Peter Thiel discussing a meeting with Dasha Zhukova (EFTA01989151), suggesting overlapping venture capital and tech circles.

### The Pigozzi Circle

Jean Pigozzi's boat hosted Martha Stewart and Brett Ratner. Pigozzi himself maintained direct email correspondence with Epstein and appeared on Edge Foundation science dinner lists alongside Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Sergey Brin, and Elon Musk. His role as a connector between the entertainment, art, and tech worlds mirrors Siegal's function in the social sphere.

### The Reuben Thread

David and Debra Reuben (entry #36) were aboard their 242-foot yacht Siren. Their presence on this list is documented in detail in the companion report: [Reuben Brothers / Siren / Chernoy](REUBEN_BROTHERS_SIREN_CHERNOY.md).

### Demarchelier and Brunel

Patrick Demarchelier (entry #11), the fashion photographer with a home in St. Barths, appears in the corpus in email threads between **Jean Luc Brunel** and Jeffrey Epstein. Brunel — the modeling agent who was a convicted Epstein associate and died in custody in February 2022 — wrote about traveling *"with Patrick Demarchelier and Russian Vogue to St. Petersburg"* in April 2012. This places Demarchelier in direct professional contact with Brunel during the period of Epstein's continued social activity.

### Woody Johnson and Ghislaine Maxwell

Woody Johnson (entry #19) — the New York Jets owner who became U.S. Ambassador to the UK under Trump — appears in a Ghislaine Maxwell chat log with the note: **"Woody Johnson ambassador to London. Wife, my old assistant."** This indicates Maxwell had a prior employment or personal assistant relationship with Johnson's wife, Suzanne Ircha Johnson. Johnson also appears on Siegal's event invite lists alongside Jared Kushner, Michael Bloomberg, and Donald Trump.

### The Aby Rosen Hub

Aby Rosen (entry #3), the real estate developer, had a **direct active relationship** with Epstein — documented through scheduled meetings via Lesley Groff, calendar entries showing "Aby Rosen's office" as a meeting location, and real estate news forwarded between them. His St. Barths home functioned as a social hub: Bob Colacello (entry #10) was staying at Rosen's, and Steve Cohen (not on the list but mentioned in the cover email) was "next door to Aby." Rosen's wife Samantha Boardman appears in a 2002 Page Six article that contains the well-known Trump quote about Epstein.

### Steve Cohen — Not on the List, But Present

Steve Cohen is not one of the 43 guest list entries but is named in Siegal's cover email: *"Steve Cohen next door to Aby (just met him)."* His 125-page corpus footprint shows Epstein was actively interested in Cohen's insider trading prosecution, his art dealings through Gagosian gallery, and his NYC real estate.

## Methodology

### Document Source
EFTA02010594 (Dataset 10), with duplicates at EFTA01830988, EFTA01792909, and EFTA00900412.

### Corpus Search
Each of the 43 names was searched using FTS5 exact phrase matching against the `pages_fts` index of `full_text_corpus.db` (2,770,154 pages across 1,385,879 documents). Page counts and document counts represent exact phrase matches only — related mentions using partial names or nicknames may exist beyond these counts.

### Limitations
- Page counts for common names (e.g., "David Geffen") may include institutional references (e.g., "David Geffen School of Medicine") that inflate the count
- The absence of direct correspondence does not prove the absence of a relationship — only that no such correspondence appears in the EFTA production
- Some names on the guest list may have additional corpus presence under variant spellings, maiden names, or nicknames not captured in exact phrase searches
