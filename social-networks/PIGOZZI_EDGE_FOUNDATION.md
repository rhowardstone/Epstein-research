# Jean Pigozzi, the Edge Foundation, and Jeffrey Epstein's Science Elite Network

## Direct Correspondence, Property Photos, and a Birthday Party on a Private Island

*Based on 284 pages across 259 documents in Datasets 9, 10, 11, and 99*

---

## Executive Summary

**Jean Pigozzi** — the Italian-French billionaire heir to the Simca automobile fortune, art collector, photographer, and founder of the Liquid Jungle Lab in Panama — maintained **direct, personal email correspondence** with Jeffrey Epstein spanning at least May 2013 to April 2014. The corpus documents them exchanging photos of their respective properties, discussing women's physical appearances, planning visits to each other's estates, and coordinating travel through Paris and the South of France.

Pigozzi's 259-document footprint in the EFTA corpus falls into four categories: (1) direct emails with Epstein, (2) 76 Edge Foundation / John Brockman dinner invitations listing both men alongside Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Sergey Brin, Larry Page, Mark Zuckerberg, and Elon Musk, (3) Peggy Siegal's social dispatches from Cannes and St. Barths, and (4) Ghislaine Maxwell's role as intermediary — including her sworn deposition testimony that she attended Sergey Brin's birthday party on Pigozzi's Caribbean island with approximately 30-50 guests, Elon Musk among them.

Most significantly, Epstein served as the conduit through which his co-defendant **Jean-Luc Brunel** obtained Pigozzi's phone number, and Epstein proposed visiting Pigozzi's Panama estate alongside former Israeli Prime Minister **Ehud Barak**.

## Thread 1: Direct Correspondence

### May 1, 2013 — "I Like Her / No Tits"

On May 1, 2013, Epstein and Pigozzi exchanged a rapid burst of emails. The thread began with Epstein reaching out after what appears to have been a recent in-person meeting:

> *"noce seeing you, do you have photso of panama?"*
>
> — Epstein to Pigozzi, May 1, 2013
> ([EFTA00642410](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00642410.pdf))

Pigozzi replied with enthusiasm:

> *"I like the red head. Seem fun and smart. Panama. Go to vanity fair on line."*
>
> — Pigozzi to Epstein
> ([EFTA00715266](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00715266.pdf))

Epstein identified the woman:

> *"german jew, daughter of the publisher of der zeit"*
>
> — Epstein to Pigozzi
> ([EFTA00959281](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00959281.pdf))

Pigozzi then replied:

> **"I like her. No tits. Small problem. Did Leon like her?"**
>
> — Pigozzi to Epstein
> ([EFTA00642405](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00642405.pdf))

"Leon" almost certainly refers to **Leon Black**, the Apollo Global Management co-founder who paid Epstein $158 million in advisory fees and appears in thousands of pages of the EFTA corpus.

In the same exchange, Epstein sent Pigozzi photos of his properties — a photo from November 6, 2012 and one from December 31, 2011. Pigozzi's responses:

> *"Looks amazing. Can't see any girls ???"*
>
> — Re: Photo from Nov 6, 2012
> ([EFTA01759711](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01759711.pdf))

> *"Great pool"*
>
> — Re: Photo from Dec 31, 2011
> ([EFTA01759729](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01759729.pdf))

Pigozzi also requested:

> *"Send me many photos of your house."*
>
> ([EFTA01788422](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01788422.pdf))

And:

> *"Did you get the photos? Send me photos of your Mashuga project"*
>
> ([EFTA00642410](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00642410.pdf))

That same day, Epstein asked Ghislaine Maxwell for Pigozzi's contact information:

> *"send me pigattzi email"*
>
> — Epstein to Maxwell, May 1, 2013
> ([EFTA00715262](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00715262.pdf))

Maxwell responded with Pigozzi's email from her TerraMar Project account.

### Summer 2013 — South of France

In late June 2013, Pigozzi and Epstein coordinated summer plans:

> *"Are you coming to the south of France this summer?"*
>
> — Pigozzi to Epstein, June 26, 2013
> ([EFTA00645471](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00645471.pdf))

> *"maybe 9th"*
>
> — Epstein to Pigozzi
> ([EFTA00963681](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00963681.pdf))

Epstein's assistant Lesley Groff created a calendar reminder:

> *"Reminder you told Jean Pigozzi you might be in the south of france around July 9th"*
>
> ([EFTA01758714](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01758714.pdf))

On July 9, Epstein followed up:

> *"where are you?"*
>
> — Epstein to Pigozzi
> ([EFTA00873424](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00873424.pdf))

> *"Cap d antibes. J"*
>
> — Pigozzi to Epstein
> ([EFTA00873430](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00873430.pdf))

### October 2013 — Paris

In October 2013, the correspondence shows Epstein and Pigozzi meeting in person in Paris:

> *"woody told me of the summer fun.,, sounded great"*
>
> — Epstein to Pigozzi, October 6, 2013
> ([EFTA00971953](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00971953.pdf))

> *"Love woody. See you in paris"*
>
> — Pigozzi to Epstein
> ([EFTA00973390](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00973390.pdf), [EFTA01754806](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01754806.pdf))

The next day:

> *"we are walking on the champs. where are you?"*
>
> — Epstein to Pigozzi, October 7, 2013
> ([EFTA00972742](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00972742.pdf))

They were together on the Champs-Élysées. "Woody" is Woody Allen, who spent summers filming in Europe and was a mutual connection.

### April 2014 — Panama with Ehud Barak

> **"I am considering going to panama with ehud barak on the 12th of may, will you be around?"**
>
> — Epstein to Pigozzi, April 28, 2014
> ([EFTA00988640](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00988640.pdf))

**Ehud Barak** — the former Prime Minister of Israel — is documented elsewhere in the corpus visiting Epstein's properties and maintaining a financial relationship. This email proposes a joint visit to Pigozzi's Panama estate, the Liquid Jungle Lab, a 270-acre private island valued by Pigozzi at over $150 million.

---

## Thread 2: The Jean-Luc Brunel Connection

On October 5, 2013, **Jean-Luc Brunel** — Epstein's longtime associate in the modeling industry, later charged with rape and sex trafficking of minors in France — texted Epstein from Panama:

> *"By any chance do you have Johnny Piggozi phone number. I amm in Panama"*
>
> — Jean-Luc Brunel to Epstein
> ([EFTA00971931](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00971931.pdf))

Epstein immediately forwarded this to Pigozzi. Pigozzi responded that he was in Paris. Epstein replied that he would be there Tuesday.

Epstein served as the switchboard connecting Brunel — who was in Panama, where Pigozzi's private island is located — to Pigozzi himself. The corpus does not show whether Brunel and Pigozzi subsequently connected or what the purpose of the contact was.

---

## Thread 3: Ghislaine Maxwell as Intermediary

Maxwell served multiple functions in the Pigozzi-Epstein relationship.

**Contact broker:** On May 1, 2013, when Epstein misspelled Pigozzi's name as "pigattzi" and asked Maxwell for his email, she provided it immediately ([EFTA00715262](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00715262.pdf)).

**Property broker:** In May 2010, Maxwell messaged Pigozzi:

> *"Are you really wanting to sell Panama and Fr property? If so price. Have potential interested party"*
>
> ([EFTA00734053](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00734053.pdf))

Pigozzi responded with valuations:

> **"FRANCE MUST BE OVER EURO 300M 22,5 ACRES. PANAMA OVER $150M JUST THE ISLAND 270 ACRES"**

Maxwell forwarded this to Epstein with the comment: *"So cheap! You wouldn't like Panama place."* Epstein replied: *"thnks"* ([EFTA00734053](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00734053.pdf)).

**Sworn testimony:** In her deposition produced as part of the House Oversight investigation (DS99), Maxwell testified about attending a party on Pigozzi's Caribbean island:

> *"I was at an event for Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google. And Sergey had arranged for — it was for his birthday. And we were — or a bunch of us, I don't even remember how many we were, but not many of us. Maybe — I don't know. If I say 40, I could be wrong. If it was 30 or 50, I don't remember. I'm sorry. Went to another friend's island. Somebody called Mr. Pigozzi in the Caribbean and — not with Epstein, he was not there, to celebrate Sergey's birthday. And we were there together for, I want to say, three or four days, something like that in my memory. And Mr. Musk was present for that."*
>
> — Ghislaine Maxwell deposition, ~2024
> (DOJ-OGR-00022759, House Oversight production, page 236)

Maxwell explicitly stated Epstein was not present at this event, which occurred around 2010.

## Thread 4: The Edge Foundation — Science Elite Network

The single largest category of Pigozzi documents in the corpus — **76 out of 259** — consists of Edge Foundation dinner invitations organized by literary agent **John Brockman**. These were exclusive gatherings of approximately 16-35 tech billionaires, Nobel laureates, and science communicators, held at venues like Spring Mountain Vineyard in Napa and the Sky Room in Long Beach.

Pigozzi is listed as: *"Investor, Art Collector; High-Tech Ecological Researcher, Liquid Jungle Lab, Panama"*

A typical invitation list (EFTA00649356, June 2011) includes:

| Name | Affiliation |
|------|------------|
| Jeff Bezos | Amazon |
| Sergey Brin | Google |
| **Jeffrey Epstein** | **"Money Manager, Science Philanthropist"** |
| Tony Fadell | Apple (iPod/iPhone) |
| Bill Gates | Microsoft / Gates Foundation |
| Daniel Kahneman | Princeton, Nobel Laureate |
| Elon Musk | SpaceX, Tesla |
| Larry Page | Google |
| Sean Parker | Facebook, Napster |
| **Jean Pigozzi** | **Liquid Jungle Lab, Panama** |
| Jacqui Safra | Encyclopædia Britannica |
| Charles Simonyi | Microsoft |
| Craig Venter | Synthetic Genomics |
| Mark Zuckerberg | Facebook |

Brockman's candid June 2011 email to Epstein reveals the social dynamics:

> *"Strangely, the usual billionaire crowd is not showing up for this one, so I am running hard to revision it as a serious science event... I hope you will come (Martin and Pinker would be very happy if you showed up) but will understand if you want out."*

And a revealing aside about tensions within the group:

> *"Kahneman thinks that beginning two years ago a lot of the usual suspects have had very good reasons not to like each other or want to be in the same room together for more than a meal. That's the sense I got a year and a half ago when at my dinner when Larry Page and Bill Joy (separately) were expressing their unhappiness about certain other friends of yours."*
>
> ([EFTA00649356](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00649356.pdf))

"Certain other friends of yours" — Brockman acknowledging that some Edge members were uncomfortable with Epstein's presence at these events, while continuing to organize them.

The Edge dinners listing both Epstein and Pigozzi span from at least 2009 through 2014 in the corpus, with a compilation document ([EFTA00261202](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00261202.pdf)) showing Pigozzi at Edge events as early as the pre-2006 era. A February 2012 confirmed attendee list shows both Epstein and Pigozzi present at a Long Beach dinner seating 16 people ([EFTA00419126](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00419126.pdf)). A March 2014 dinner in Vancouver shows them on the same invitation list alongside Yuri Milner, Marissa Mayer, and Anne Wojcicki ([EFTA00469644](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00469644.pdf)).

Separately, a February 2011 Edge dinner in New York lists both Pigozzi and "Gmax Maxwell" alongside Epstein, Freeman Dyson, Eric Kandel, Daniel Kahneman, Robert Trivers, and Lee Smolin ([EFTA01799443](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01799443.pdf)).

## Thread 5: The Social Circuit — Cannes, St. Barths, and Naomi Campbell

Pigozzi's overlap with Epstein's network extended through the luxury social circuit maintained by Peggy Siegal.

**Cannes Film Festival:**

Pigozzi held an annual lunch at his seaside villa near the Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc during the festival. Siegal reported to Epstein:

> *"Sunday, saw morning screening of 'Agora' with Rachel Weisz (Egypt in 349 AD) and Johnny Pigozzi had his annual lunch at his seaside villa next to DuCap. Chased Mick Jagger around the pool all afternoon"*
>
> — May 2009
> ([EFTA01828642](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01828642.pdf))

In May 2011, Siegal reported attending Woody Allen's *Midnight in Paris* premiere with Pigozzi:

> *"Went to Woody's opening with Jean Pigozzi tonight. Film delightful, smart, funny, romantic...excellent Woody."*
>
> ([EFTA01862368](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01862368.pdf))

In July 2011, Siegal stayed at Pigozzi's home in St. Tropez:

> *"I came off 'Lady Joy' in St. Tropez on Sunday. Stayed at Jean Pigozzi's Monday night with director Brett Ratner."*
>
> ([EFTA00915839](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00915839.pdf))

**St. Barths (Christmas 2010):**

Pigozzi appears as Entry #32 on Siegal's 43-name guest list compiled for Harvey Weinstein: *"Jean Pigozzi — Dec 23rd — Staying on his boat"* ([EFTA02010594](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02010594.pdf)). Brett Ratner (Entry #34) is listed as staying on *"John Pigozzi boat."*

> *"Johnny Pigozzi had the chicest lunch on his My Amazon Express with Demi Moore, Ashton Kushner, Salma Hayek, David Geffen etc."*
>
> ([EFTA02004248](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02004248.pdf))

**Siegal's pitch for Pigozzi's 60th birthday (January 2011):**

> *"Jean Pigozzi having a 60th on Jan 2 in Panama estate. Want to go for 4 days. Have not been invited and he is a friend. Asked Tamara Mellon to ask him to invite me. She is. Will be beyond cool. People will come from St Barths."*
>
> ([EFTA00672589](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00672589.pdf))

**Naomi Campbell's birthday (May 2015):**

> *"Naomi arrived at midnight as Johnny Pigozzi, Karla Otto and I were leaving."*
>
> ([EFTA00347515](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00347515.pdf))

## Thread 6: Art Market and Photography

Pigozzi operated at the intersection of the art world and Epstein's network. He appeared on event guest lists alongside Larry Gagosian, was described as a "photographer bon vivant" in press coverage, and had a book signing at a St. Barths gallery where "billionaires Nat Rothschild, Nicolas Berggruen and Paul Allen bought books" ([EFTA01156068](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01156068.pdf)).

An art transaction record lists a "Jean Pigozzi / Tierney Gearon" piece at $54,000 ([EFTA00599200](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00599200.pdf)).

Pigozzi had a cameo role in Oliver Stone's *Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps* as "an international banker" — reported in detail by Siegal, who was on set ([EFTA00744357](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00744357.pdf)).

A November 2015 screening invitation lists Pigozzi as co-host alongside Bennett Miller, Wendi Murdoch, and Diane von Furstenberg for Kevin Macdonald's documentary *Sky Ladder* ([EFTA01744806](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01744806.pdf)).

A press clipping placed Pigozzi alongside Ghislaine Maxwell in a photograph captioned:

> *"Ghislaine Maxwell with Wendi Deng Murdoch; Mick Jagger; Jean Pigozzi; and Colin Firth"*
>
> ([EFTA01164600](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01164600.pdf))

---

## Thread 7: The Accidental Email

On May 18, 2013, Pigozzi accidentally forwarded Epstein an internal business email from an employee named Marlon Sporer — a "daily report" about swimshort designs and patterns for his Limoland fashion brand destined for Barneys:

> *"Did touch-ups to the photo of the swimmer with the Limo Swimshorts. Also made the swimshorts longer. Made new colorways for the Solid Giraffes, I Have Planes and Aquatic Life Patterns for the Barneys pack."*

Epstein replied: *"Oy"*

Pigozzi: *"SORRY WRONG PERSON. HAVE A GREAT SUMMER. JEAN"*

([EFTA01762950](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01762950.pdf))

The accidental forward confirms the casual familiarity of the relationship — Pigozzi had Epstein in his recent contacts close enough to confuse him with a business employee.

---

## What This Shows and What It Doesn't

**What it shows:**

The corpus documents a genuine personal relationship between Jean Pigozzi and Jeffrey Epstein — not a passing acquaintance or a name on a mailing list, but direct, casual correspondence involving property photos, travel coordination, discussion of women's physical attributes, and mutual social planning with Woody Allen. The relationship was active from at least 2010 (when Maxwell was brokering Pigozzi's property valuations) through at least April 2014 (when Epstein proposed visiting Panama with Ehud Barak).

The Edge Foundation provided the institutional framework for this relationship. 76 documents place Pigozzi and Epstein on the same invitation lists for exclusive science dinners organized by John Brockman — events that seated 16 people and counted Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Sergey Brin, Larry Page, and Mark Zuckerberg as regular attendees. Brockman's own emails acknowledge that some members were uncomfortable with Epstein's presence but continued organizing the events.

Epstein functioned as a social switchboard within this network. When Jean-Luc Brunel needed Pigozzi's phone number from Panama, he texted Epstein. When Maxwell wanted to broker the sale of Pigozzi's properties, she went through Epstein. When Pigozzi wanted context on a "red head" he'd met, Epstein identified her.

**What it doesn't show:**

There is no evidence in these documents that Jean Pigozzi was involved in, aware of, or complicit in Jeffrey Epstein's crimes. The "I like her / No tits" exchange and the "Can't see any girls???" comment are crude but do not by themselves indicate criminal conduct. Maxwell's testimony explicitly placed Epstein as absent from the Sergey Brin birthday party on Pigozzi's island.

What the documents reveal is structural: how the Edge Foundation's science dinner circuit, the Cannes/St. Barths social season, and the intermediary functions of Maxwell and Siegal created an ecosystem in which a convicted sex offender maintained direct, comfortable relationships with some of the wealthiest people in the world — and nobody in the network treated this as unusual.
