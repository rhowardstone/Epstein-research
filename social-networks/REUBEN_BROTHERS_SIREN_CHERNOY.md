# The Reuben Brothers, the Siren Yacht, and the Chernoy Warning

## An Investigation into David and Simon Reuben in the Epstein Files

*Based on 164 documents across Datasets 9, 10, and 11 of the DOJ EFTA production*

---

## Executive Summary

The EFTA corpus contains a detailed record of how **David Reuben** — the Mumbai-born British billionaire of Baghdadi Jewish descent who, with his brother Simon, amassed a fortune in Russian metals during the 1990s "Aluminum Wars" — was introduced to Jeffrey Epstein's social orbit in March 2010. The introduction was brokered by **Peggy Siegal**, the New York film publicist who functioned as a social intelligence conduit for Epstein during his house arrest period.

The documents reveal that on the same day Siegal pitched Reuben to Epstein, an unidentified source sent Epstein a warning: *"Reuben bros have very murky past in ex Sov Union with Michael Chernoy. Semi sanitised now."* Two months later, Epstein used Chernoy's name as a benchmark for toxic associations when warning **Peter Mandelson** to stay away from certain individuals.

No direct correspondence between the Reuben brothers and Epstein has been found in the corpus. All references are mediated through intermediaries — primarily Peggy Siegal, but also financial broker **David Stern** and private equity investor **Frederick Iseman**. Despite this, the Reubens appear on social guest lists alongside Epstein's closest associates, and **Reuben Brothers Limited** appears in Deutsche Bank records produced under grand jury subpoena.

## Part 1: The Introduction — March 20-21, 2010

### The Setting

In March 2010, Jeffrey Epstein was approximately four months from completing house arrest in Palm Beach, Florida (ending July 20, 2010). Despite his legal restrictions, he continued to receive social intelligence from his network — particularly from Peggy Siegal, who functioned as a roving social scout among the ultra-wealthy.

### The LeFrak Dinner at Mar-a-Lago

On the evening of Saturday, March 20, 2010, Peggy Siegal attended a dinner hosted by **Richard LeFrak** at Mar-a-Lago. She was seated next to David Reuben. She immediately began texting/emailing Epstein:

> *"I am sitting next to him. He lives in London and Cannes. Has a yacht called Siren that is 242 feet. He is going to Antigua tomorrow. He has done business is Russia for many years — he was the first western investor in Russia...he is into many fab scientific investments...you need to meet him. How far is your island from Antigua? He is a major nice guy. You would like him...how does he meet you..."*
>
> — Peggy Siegal to Epstein, March 20, 2010, 11:11 PM
> [EFTA02429452 (DS11)]

### Epstein's Immediate Interest

Epstein responded the next morning with enthusiasm:

> *"bring him over tomorrow for tea"*
>
> — Epstein to Siegal, March 21, 2010, 8:51 AM
> [EFTA01826629 (DS10) / EFTA00747013 (DS9)]

Within 90 minutes of responding to Siegal, Epstein reached out to **Peter Mandelson** to check on Reuben's credentials:

> *"david reuben, wants to come see me today, do you know him"*
>
> — Epstein to Mandelson, March 21, 2010, 10:15 AM
> [EFTA01826751 (DS10) / EFTA00890033 (DS9)]

Mandelson replied within two minutes:

> *"A Reuben brother ?"*
>
> — Mandelson to Epstein, March 21, 2010, 10:17 AM
> [EFTA01826716 (DS10) / EFTA00691555 (DS9)]

Epstein confirmed: **"yes"** [EFTA00890038 (DS9)].

### The Reversal

Despite his initial interest, Epstein reversed course within the hour:

> *"Im sorry peggy, for the moment i am without help at the house. it makes this impossible. thanks for your consideration and understanding"*
>
> — Epstein, March 21, 2010, 10:23 AM
> [EFTA01826735 (DS10)]

An unnamed person (possibly an assistant) replied to a forwarded version of the thread: *"What time? Should I ask Peggy?"* [EFTA02429420 (DS11)], suggesting someone in Epstein's circle was prepared to facilitate the meeting despite Epstein's stated reluctance.

### Siegal's Detailed Dossier

Later that day, Siegal sent Epstein a comprehensive biographical profile of David Reuben:

> *"He left this morning on his jet to his 242 foot boat 'Siren' at Antigua. He is a Jew that was born in Bagdad. He grew up in Bombay till he was 15 when the family moved to London. He has a brother Simon. Francine LeFrak is friendly with Simon who has a huge house in St. Tropez. Richard LeFrak recently, in the past two years got friendly with David."*
>
> *"David knows Len Blavatnik. I think they are friendly competitors. He also knows Jarecki and has been to their island... He was very interesting and low key. Gives tons to Israel. Hospitals. Invests in medical...is about to announce a new machine for accurate breast cancer detection. Also a substance that hardens bone in the mouth..."*
>
> *"His enormous villa (has a ballroom/media room)... right up the hill from The Carlton."*
>
> *"I really think this is a guy you can relate to. Do you want me to pursue this? He speaks many languages. He has done extensive business in China, Korea and mid-East. He is in metals and oil."*
>
> — Peggy Siegal to Epstein, March 21, 2010
> [EFTA00762876 (DS9)]

**Note on biographical accuracy:** Siegal's sketch was imprecise. Public records and the Reuben Brothers' own statements confirm the brothers were born in Bombay (Mumbai) to an Iraqi-Jewish (Baghdadi Jewish) family. Their father had migrated from Baghdad to India. Siegal's claim that David was "born in Bagdad" is incorrect; in a later email she also described them as "Syrian Jews" ([EFTA02025786](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02025786.pdf)), which is also inaccurate.

---

## Part 2: The Chernoy Warning — Same Day

### The Anonymous Warning

On the same day that Siegal was pitching Reuben to Epstein, an unidentified source sent Epstein a terse warning:

> **"Correction. Reuben bros have very murky past in ex Sov Union with Michael Chernoy. Semi sanitised now. Huge assets."**
>
> — Unidentified sender to Epstein, March 21, 2010
> [EFTA00762882 (DS9) / EFTA02428456 (DS11)]

The word "Correction" implies the sender had previously communicated something positive (or neutral) about the Reubens and was now amending that assessment. The sender's identity is redacted, but the email was sent from a BlackBerry device to `jeevacation@gmail.com`.

### Who Was Michael Chernoy?

Michael Chernoy (also transliterated as **Michael Cherney**) was a Russian-Israeli metals oligarch who operated in the same 1990s Russian metals markets as the Reuben brothers. The Reubens and Chernoy were business partners in Trans-World Group, which controlled a significant portion of Russia's aluminum industry during the chaotic post-Soviet privatization period.

Chernoy later sued oligarch Oleg Deripaska in English courts. The case — **Cherney v Deripaska** — became a landmark in international commercial litigation.

### The Iseman Corroboration

Independently, on the same day, **Frederick Iseman** — who was already friends with Simon Reuben — provided additional context about the brothers' Russian past in an email exchange with Peggy Siegal (which Siegal forwarded to Epstein):

> *"Read the Fortune magazine cover story on the Reubens in Russian of about 15 years ago during the Aluminum Wars. Simon says unfair and untrue. And I believe Simon. But what is clear is that this was kgb gangland warfare by proxy. As rough as it gets. They were very lucky to get out with their money, unharmed. It'll make your eyes pop."*
>
> — Frederick Iseman, March 21, 2010
> [EFTA00761567 (DS9) / EFTA02426871 (DS11)]

The same email thread contains a notable aside from Iseman: *"Visited Jeffrey Epstein today in Palm Beach. He has four more months of house arrest. July 20 he is out of Florida for good."*

### Epstein's Use of "Chernoy" as Shorthand

Two months later, Epstein demonstrated that the Chernoy warning had registered. In a May 30, 2010 email to **Peter Mandelson**, Epstein warned him to distance himself from someone (apparently connected to Alastair Campbell), using Chernoy as a benchmark for toxic associations:

> *"good, careful, he talks... re alistair. not a very class act to follow... the risk is that he has now set up the standard of trash, **i would like you as far away from that as i would from chernoy**"*
>
> — Epstein to Peter Mandelson, May 30, 2010
> [EFTA02529712 (DS11)]

This email confirms Epstein was aware of — and wary of — the Chernoy connection, and considered proximity to Chernoy a reputational hazard worth warning associates about.

### The Wider Chernoy Network

Separately, a series of near-identical whistleblower letters from Christopher J. Dilorio to the SEC/DOJ — copies of essentially the same complaint sent on different dates — place Cherney in a broader associative chain:

> **Martin Schlaff → Cherney → Russia → Firtash → Mogilevich**
>
> [EFTA00086291 (DS9)]

These are unverified allegations from a single complainant, not investigative findings. But they provide context for why the name "Chernoy" carried weight: **Dmytro Firtash** is the Ukrainian gas oligarch indicted by the DOJ in 2013 on bribery charges, and **Semion Mogilevich** was placed on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list.

## Part 3: The Social Overlap — 2010-2011

Despite the declined March 2010 meeting, the Reuben and Epstein social circles continued to overlap through their shared connections — particularly Peggy Siegal.

### Cannes Film Festival, May 2010

Siegal reported back to Epstein from Cannes:

> *"Went on David Reuben's 242 foot boat today. Two years old. Just magnificent...hung with Wall Street cast for 3 days...miss you...xoxo Peg"*
>
> — Peggy Siegal to Epstein, May 17, 2010
> [EFTA02424055 (DS11) / EFTA00758510 (DS9)]

She also reported that David Reuben was lending his Cannes villa to 20th Century Fox for the *Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps* premiere party [EFTA02427696 (DS11)].

### The St. Barths Christmas 2010 Guest List

In December 2010, Peggy Siegal compiled a detailed guest list/contact sheet for the St. Barths social season and sent it to **Harvey Weinstein** (with a copy reaching Epstein's files). This document — **EFTA02010594** — is a who's-who of the ultra-wealthy social circuit, with 43 entries including:

| # | Name(s) | Location/Notes |
|---|---------|---------------|
| 1 | Dasha Zhukova / Roman Abramovich | On their boat |
| 6 | Stephanie Seymour / Peter Brant | |
| 17 | Shala Monroque / Larry Gagosian | House next to Isle de France |
| 18 | David Geffen | On Roman's boat |
| 24 | **Ghislaine Maxwell** | **Staying on Billy Kotick's boat** |
| 29 | Tico Mugrabi | |
| 31 | Vivi Nevo | On his own boat |
| 32 | Jean Pigozzi | Staying on his boat |
| 33 | Selma Hayek Pinault / François-Henri Pinault | Vivi Nevo's boat |
| 34 | Brett Ratner | Jean Pigozzi's boat |
| **36** | **Debra / David Reuben** | **On their boat / Siren** |
| 39 | Martha Stewart | Jean Pigozzi's boat |
| 42 | **Georgina Chapman / Harvey Weinstein** | On boat |

The full list contains 43 entries with phone numbers and accommodations. It exists in at least four copies across the corpus: EFTA02010594, EFTA01830988, EFTA01792909, and EFTA00900412.

*Note: Ghislaine Maxwell is listed as staying on "Billy Kotick's boat" — likely referring to Bobby Kotick, then-CEO of Activision Blizzard.*

### New Year's Day 2011

On January 1, 2011, Siegal sent Epstein her New Year's dispatch from St. Barths:

> *"Then went to Debbie and David Reuben's 243ft boat Siren for lunch. Then took them to my beach at Taiwana and Isle De France where it was packed with nervous people comparing New Year's Eve parties."*
>
> — Peggy Siegal to Epstein, January 1, 2011
> [EFTA01832581 (DS10) / EFTA01800372 (DS10) / EFTA00664216 (DS9)]

The same email references Harvey Weinstein, George Lucas, Roman Abramovich, Dasha Zhukova, Rupert Murdoch, Martha Stewart, David Geffen, Ron Perelman, Peter Brant, Stephanie Seymour, and Larry Gagosian.

### Cannes Film Festival, May 2011

Siegal's 2011 Cannes reporting to Epstein continued the Reuben thread:

> *"Debbie and David Reuben (brother of Simon) both from London...Syrian Jews who cornered the Russian market on aluminum...and have a 243 foot gorgeous boat...we can go on will be around. Do you know him. Very very rich and nice hamasha guy."*
>
> — Peggy Siegal to Epstein, May 2, 2011
> [EFTA02025786 (DS10)]

> *"Got Debbie and David Reuben (from London and he is a billionaire from aluminum market in Russia) to give me a bed in his home above the Carlton that King Leopold built...for the last weekend."*
>
> — Peggy Siegal to Epstein, May 17, 2011
> [EFTA01985378 (DS10)]

Siegal also published a "Cannes Diary" describing taking the Reubens to Sean Penn's film premiere:

> *"I have invited Debra and David Reuben (normal people, not in the business) to the premiere of Sean Penn's 'This Must be the Place.'... I take the Reubens to the after-party at Cherie Cheri Beach where Courtney Love explains to us Sean's character is based on a friend of Bono's."*
>
> [EFTA02690174 (DS11) / EFTA00296005 (DS9)]

## Part 4: The Business Proposals — 2011

**David Stern**, a financial intermediary, twice pitched Epstein on business opportunities involving the Reuben family.

### Allied Irish Bank Portfolio ($10 Billion)

> *"Allied Irish Bank US property portfolio: US$ 10 billion. Met with Reuben family today, they are putting in a bid: US$ 1.5 billion equity, US$ 5 billion debt financing (term sheet in place). They will bid US$6.5bn for about US$8bn of the portfolio. All the big houses are competitors (Blackstone, Paulson, Goldman) so they think their chances are not very high. They would like a strong partner for the bid, to increase it and to bid for the total US$10bn. More information I can not get as its confidential. Interesting?"*
>
> — David Stern to Epstein, August 2, 2011, Subject: "confidential"
> [EFTA01857642 (DS10) / EFTA02692915 (DS11)]

### Luup Mobile Payments Joint Venture

> *"My Chinese friend Wu Zheng (worth $1billion) is visiting me in London. I arranged meeting with David Reuben (worth $8.5 billion). The three of us discussed company Luup owned by Reuben: best mobile payment technology, mainly banking without an account. We will do JV for Luup in China (Wu, Reuben, Me). This system is perfect for Africa and Chartered Bank wants to have it for Africa. Something we should do as part of your African initiative?"*
>
> — David Stern to Epstein, December 8, 2011
> [EFTA02007134 (DS10) / EFTA00925628 (DS9) / EFTA02548082 (DS11)]

The corpus does not contain Epstein's replies to either proposal.

## Part 5: The Deutsche Bank Records

**Reuben Brothers Limited** appears in Deutsche Bank internal records produced under **Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)** — meaning they were part of grand jury subpoena materials in the SDNY investigation.

| Document | Content |
|----------|---------|
| EFTA01362617 (DS10) | Deutsche Bank KCP EMEA client list: "REUBEN BROTHERS LIMITED" — Account 1000639994_GB, managed by Raphael Drescher, flagged **"RED"** |
| EFTA01362614 (DS10) | Internal DB email: *"Reuben showing red also you confirmed green on 27/7"* |
| EFTA01406355 (DS10) | Combined client list: "Reuben Brothers Limited 1.000639994E9 — Drescher — KCP EMEA" |

The "RED" flag in Deutsche Bank's Key Client Partners (KCP) program indicates an elevated compliance risk rating. The records place the Reubens as wealth management clients at the same institution — and in the same division — implicated in Epstein's financial dealings.

A "CHERNOV" also appears in Deutsche Bank's US Private Banking client list (EFTA01460984, DS10) with $1.82 million in assets, though this may be a different individual.

## Part 6: Confirmed Non-Connections

### EFTA00608737 — Reuben Kobulnik / Valor Global Fund III

This document is a $3 million capital call notice dated April 18, 2017, for "Valor Global Fund III LP," signed by **Reuben Kobulnik**, COO/CFO of Valor Ventures LLC. The investor is "Southern Trust Company, Inc." with a total commitment of $25 million.

**This document has no connection to David or Simon Reuben.** The shared first name is coincidental. Valor Ventures LLC is a separate New York-based venture capital firm.

### Reuben Jeffery III — Rockefeller & Co.

A separate individual — **Reuben Jeffery III**, President and CEO of Rockefeller & Co. (formerly Goldman Sachs, former U.S. Under Secretary of State) — also appears in the corpus. He is connected to Epstein through separate channels:

- **Jes Staley** forwarded Jeffery's emails to Epstein in July 2015, discussing corporate leadership succession [EFTA02494809 (DS11)]
- **Ariane de Rothschild** forwarded Rockefeller & Co. business correspondence involving Jeffery to Epstein in March 2016 [EFTA01804425 (DS10)]

Reuben Jeffery III is not related to the Reuben brothers and appears in an entirely separate context.

---

## Methodology

### Search Terms
- FTS5: `reuben`, `"david reuben"`, `"simon reuben"`, `"reuben brothers"`, `rueben` (misspelling)
- FTS5: `chernoy`, `chernov`, `cherney`
- FTS5: `siren`, `siren AND yacht`, `siren AND reuben`

### Corpus Coverage
- **209 pages** across **164 unique documents** match "reuben" (includes unrelated individuals such as Reuben Jeffery III and Reuben Kobulnik)
- **32 pages** across **32 documents** match Chernoy/Chernov/Cherney variants combined (many from repeated Dilorio whistleblower letters)
- **419 pages** across **353 documents** match "siren" (most are unrelated uses of the common English word; approximately 13 are relevant to the yacht)
- Documents span Datasets 9, 10, and 11

### Duplicate Handling
Many emails appear in multiple datasets (DS9, DS10, DS11) as separate EFTA numbers. Where duplicates were identified, all EFTA numbers are cited. The narrative prioritizes the most complete version of each email.

### Analytical Notes
- No direct correspondence between Epstein and either David or Simon Reuben was found
- All Reuben references are mediated through third parties (Siegal, Stern, Iseman)
- The absence of direct correspondence does not prove the absence of direct contact — only that no such correspondence appears in the EFTA production
- The Deutsche Bank records were produced under grand jury subpoena and their presence in the Epstein files reflects the scope of the SDNY investigation, not necessarily a direct financial link between the Reubens and Epstein
