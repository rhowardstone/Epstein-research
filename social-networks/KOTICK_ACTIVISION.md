## Timeline of Documented Interactions

### Phase 1: Maxwell as Intermediary (2004–2010)

The earliest Kotick appearance in the corpus is a flirtatious exchange with Ghislaine Maxwell.

**April 24, 2004** — Kotick replies to Maxwell:

> "Mend it together and bring that sexy body that goes with it out to my town. I'll ring."

Maxwell had written: "You don't ring, you don't write.. Yours heart broken Ghislaine"

— [EFTA00579125](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00579125.pdf) (DS9)

This establishes an existing personal relationship between Kotick and Maxwell by 2004. The "you don't ring, you don't write" framing implies prior contact beyond what the corpus captures.

**February 11, 2009** — Epstein emails Maxwell: "no kotick as of yet" — indicating they were actively trying to recruit or schedule Kotick for something.

— [EFTA00748504](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00748504.pdf) (DS9)

**March 4, 2009** — Epstein reports to Maxwell:

> "spoke to bobby kotick... he ws with brett ratner... he asked for a pilot for his 407, and his gulfstream... also bobby said he is learning to fly."

Epstein connected Kotick with "Darren — larry's friend. the great heli pilot."

— [EFTA01827176](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01827176.pdf) (DS10)

This shows Epstein providing logistical favors — connecting Kotick with aviation personnel for his Bell 407 helicopter and Gulfstream jet.

**June 22–23, 2010** — Maxwell forwards a Kotick message to Epstein. Maxwell had asked Kotick: "Hey, do you have a GV in pre buy? What did you pay for it?" Kotick replied:

> "Its confidential but ill call you. Tell Darren to keep quiet."

Maxwell forwarded to Epstein: "Didn't hear from yet."

— [EFTA00747200](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00747200.pdf) (DS9)

"GV" = Gulfstream V. "Darren" is likely Darren Indyke, Epstein's long-time attorney. Maxwell was brokering aircraft intelligence for Epstein through Kotick.

**November 30, 2010** — Maxwell to Epstein:

> "I didn't end up seeing Bobby last night so I sent him an e mail.."

She forwards Kotick's reply: "This trip no time. What can I bring tonight?"

Maxwell's original pitch to Kotick: "Jeffrey would Love to see you if you have time. Something to do w/business."

— [EFTA00751692](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00751692.pdf) (DS9)

Maxwell was still actively trying to arrange Epstein-Kotick meetings as of late 2010.

**December 21, 2010** — The St. Barths Christmas 2010 guest list compiled by Peggy Siegal includes:

> "24. Ghislaine Maxwell — Staying on Billy Kotick's boat"

This is a 43-person guest list for a St. Barths screening organized by Siegal. Others listed include Roman Abramovich, David Geffen, Larry Gagosian, Harvey Weinstein, Jean Pigozzi, Brett Ratner, Martha Stewart, David Reuben, and Ron Perelman.

— [EFTA01792909](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01792909.pdf) p.3 (DS10)

Maxwell staying on Kotick's yacht at St. Barths demonstrates the social integration of this network beyond email correspondence.

---

### Phase 2: Direct Epstein-Kotick Correspondence (2012–2014)

By November 2012, the Maxwell intermediary phase appears to have ended. Epstein and Kotick correspond directly.

#### The November 2012 Dinner Circuit

**November 10, 2012** — Epstein to Kotick: "are you coming to my coast soon?"

Kotick: "Maybe next weekend. How are you?"

— [EFTA01980091](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01980091.pdf) (DS10)

**November 11, 2012** — Epstein to Kotick:

> "if so, come see me, i will be in new york, on sat possibly david blaine, and woody alien at the house, you will enjoy them as they will enjoy you."

Kotick: "I should be in around 7. Ill come find you saturday. What's your address?"

Epstein, CC'ing assistant Lesley Groff: "9 east 71" — Epstein's Upper East Side townhouse.

— [EFTA01980091](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01980091.pdf), [EFTA01765734](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01765734.pdf), [EFTA01980254](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01980254.pdf) (DS10)

**November 13, 2012** — Epstein tells Kotick: "possibly steve sinofsky will also be there, resigned from microsoft yesterday"

— [EFTA01977852](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01977852.pdf) (DS10)

**November 13, 2012** — Epstein's assistant Lesley Groff emails Kotick's assistants:

> "Jeffrey is wondering if by any chance, Bobby could change his trip and come Friday night, Nov. 16th at 7:30 for dinner...Woody Allen will be coming this night and Jeffrey really would like Bobby and Woody to meet. Unfortunately, Woody cannot come on Saturday Nov. 17th."

— [EFTA02155539](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02155539.pdf) (DS10)

Follow-up from Groff: "Bobby Kotick's office says they will need to get back to us re Bobby coming in earlier on Friday to make it to the woody dinner at 7:30...his assistant doesn't think there will be enough [time]."

— [EFTA01980347](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01980347.pdf) (DS10)

**November 17, 2012** — Epstein's schedule confirms: "7:00 DINNER w/Bobby Kotick" at 9 East 71st Street, New York.

— [EFTA00308115](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00308115.pdf) p.2 (DS9)

**November 18, 2012** — Epstein tells Brock Pierce:

> "not sure yet, had bobby kotick here for dinner last night, heard lots about the future"

Pierce replies: "Interesting. He went out with a friend of mine after. What'd you learn?"

— [EFTA01977865](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01977865.pdf), [EFTA01978060](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01978060.pdf) (DS10)

#### The Thanksgiving 2012 Island Invitation

**November 20, 2012** — Groff emails Kotick's office with phone numbers for Epstein's island:

> "Jeffrey Epstein understands you will be down in St. Thomas some over the holidays. Jeffrey requested I please pass along some phone numbers..."

— [EFTA02155323](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02155323.pdf) (DS10)

**November 21, 2012** — An Epstein calendar reminder reads: "did bobby kotick and howard lutnick get my email yesterday re island #'s?"

— [EFTA02155312](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02155312.pdf) (DS10)

**November 22, 2012** — Epstein emails Kotick on Thanksgiving Day:

> "have you guys decided your schedule. for island. what idea makes sense for Steve sinofsky,"

Kotick replies:

> "I think we are going right to Virgin Gorda. He should go run Google Apps."

— [EFTA01976586](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01976586.pdf), [EFTA02011128](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02011128.pdf) (DS10)

**November 23, 2012** — Epstein: "if you all want to tour of the island let me know, I am in palm beach"

Kotick: "Very nice of you to offer. I don't think it is going to work with the schedule. It was fun being with you and your teams of experts."

— [EFTA00671676](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00671676.pdf) (DS9)

**November 24, 2012** — Epstein's schedule notes: "(Bobby Kotick on St. Thomas)"

— [EFTA00308115](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00308115.pdf) p.4 (DS9)

**December 9, 2012** — Kotick: "Great, wished would could have stopped by the island."

— [EFTA01765212](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01765212.pdf) (DS10)

The "teams of experts" comment is notable. Kotick was sufficiently impressed by the people Epstein assembled at the November 17 dinner to reference them afterward. The island invitation, while ultimately declined, shows the relationship had progressed to the point where a Caribbean visit was being actively coordinated.

#### The February 2013 SpaceX / Beverly Hills Weekend

**February 24, 2013** — Epstein emails Kotick:

> "the girls and i are going to see elon musk at space x tomorrow, are you around,"

Kotick: "Im here but tied up during the day. Do you want my 407 to fly to Hawthorne Airport?"

Epstein: "No thanks I'm in longbeach"

Kotick: "Want it to take you from Long Beach?"

Epstein: "Thanks, but rather see you. Taking girls after to bel air"

— [EFTA00954882](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00954882.pdf) (DS9)

**February 25, 2013** — Kotick asks about Epstein's TED conference dinner plans. Epstein:

> "not going to a dinner, just holding court in the westin in bill gates suite, come later if you like or i will meet you in bev hills. ?"

Kotick:

> "Come with your friends to my house at 530, 1011 Cove Way, Bev Hills, 10 minutes from Bel Air."

— [EFTA00700778](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00700778.pdf) (DS9)

**February 25, 2013** — Epstein forwards the entire Kotick thread — including Kotick's "Come with your friends to my house" invitation — to at least two women, one identified as "Svet."

— [EFTA00954885](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00954885.pdf) (DS9), [EFTA02566617](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02566617.pdf) (DS11)

The forwarded thread contains the full exchange: Epstein mentioning "the girls" going to SpaceX, Kotick offering his helicopter, and ultimately Kotick inviting Epstein and friends to 1011 Cove Way. Epstein passed this invitation along to unnamed female companions.

Note: 1011 Cove Way, Beverly Hills, was publicly reported as Kotick's residence.

#### The April–May 2013 Los Angeles Trip

**April 27, 2013** — Epstein emails Kotick:

> "arriving with crew in tow tomorw at bel air at 7 pm what are you doing are you going to milken?"

Kotick: "I will be around monday and tuesday. Let me know."

— [EFTA01973391](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01973391.pdf), [EFTA01758697](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01758697.pdf) (DS10)

A Google Calendar reminder lists Epstein's LA agenda: "People to see in LA: Slayton, Sophie, Josephson, Elon, Kotick, Tisch"

— [EFTA01975404](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01975404.pdf) (DS10)

**April 29, 2013** — Kotick invites Epstein: "Drinks tomorrow my house 530?"

— [EFTA01761661](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01761661.pdf) (DS10)

Epstein tells Steve Tisch:

> "L.A.-usual suspects. lets try to catch up wed in ny. I will go to Koticks house for drinks, do you think Brian Grazer might be up for a coffee? as you said he likes to find smart, interesting people I never met him"

Tisch replies: "You would enjoy meeting Grazer. Kotick should invite him to meet you"

Epstein: "good idea"

— [EFTA01972875](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01972875.pdf), [EFTA01973042](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01973042.pdf) (DS10)

Someone asks Epstein: "Is Bobby taking up your entire evening?"

— [EFTA01759396](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01759396.pdf) (DS10)

**April 30, 2013** — Epstein to Kotick: "great house, great art, i am in ny 1-6 if you have time when you come"

Kotick: "Thanks. Great guests. See you in NYC."

— [EFTA01972835](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01972835.pdf), [EFTA01758711](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01758711.pdf) (DS10)

#### The Edutainment / Gaming Thread

**May 2, 2013** — Epstein sends Kotick a lengthy pitch about using video games for education:

> "Im meeting with Joel Klein on monday, any edutainment games that you like already out there"
>
> "Play 'Medal of Honor' or 'Call of Duty' and you will learn war history... Video games are already great at teaching... we have to use computers to replace teachers - or at least augment them."
>
> "The best scheme I've come up with so far is to use X-Prize or something like it to co-opt the existing video game industry."

— [EFTA01976025](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01976025.pdf) (DS10)

**May 3, 2013** — Kotick responds substantively:

> "X prize is a good idea but key is real world rewards. Learn to read: earn cell phone minutes, iphone credits, virtual items in games."

— [EFTA01761115](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01761115.pdf) (DS10)

#### Hacker Conference Invitations (Summer 2013)

Epstein repeatedly invited Kotick to attend a hacker convention (likely DEF CON) in Las Vegas:

**May 19, 2013**: "All August begins with hacker conference Vegas July 30" / Kotick: "No plans. When New Mexico?"

— [EFTA01974076](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01974076.pdf) (DS10)

**July 18, 2013**: "are you going to meet me at the hackers convention on aug 3 vegas, come to the ranch either before or after in santa fe."

Kotick: "I wish I could. I have to be in NY. Let me know when you go to Santa Fe again."

— [EFTA01966167](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01966167.pdf), [EFTA01963115](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01963115.pdf) (DS10)

**July 29, 2013**: "we are going to hacker convention in las vegas sat-sun come"

Kotick: "Wish I could. Tied up this weekend. Have fun."

— [EFTA01965053](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01965053.pdf), [EFTA01966697](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01966697.pdf) (DS10)

#### Latest Known Contact (2014)

**May 18, 2014** — An unnamed person emails Epstein:

> "[redacted] suggests that you introduce cute Italian hacker guy to Bobby Kotick"

— [EFTA01752492](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01752492.pdf) (DS10)

This is the latest dated Kotick reference in the corpus.

## Key Observations

### 1. The Forwarding Pattern

The February 2013 SpaceX weekend reveals a troubling dynamic. Epstein told Kotick he was going to see Elon Musk at SpaceX with "the girls." Kotick offered his helicopter. Kotick then invited Epstein and "your friends" to his Beverly Hills home. Epstein forwarded the entire thread — including Kotick's home address — to at least two women, one identified as "Svet."

Whether Kotick knew that "friends" meant Epstein's female companions is unknowable from the corpus alone. What is documented is that Epstein used Kotick's open invitation as a vehicle to bring unnamed women to a private residence.

### 2. Maxwell's Role

Between 2004 and 2010, Maxwell was the primary conduit between Kotick and Epstein. She:
- Maintained a flirtatious personal relationship with Kotick (2004)
- Brokered Gulfstream purchase intelligence through Kotick for Epstein (2010)
- Pitched business meetings between Kotick and Epstein (2010)
- Stayed on Kotick's yacht at St. Barths (Christmas 2010)

By 2012, Maxwell disappears from the Kotick correspondence. Epstein and Kotick communicate directly.

### 3. "Teams of Experts"

After the November 17, 2012 dinner at 9 East 71st Street, Kotick wrote: "It was fun being with you and your teams of experts." The dinner guest list included David Blaine and potentially Steve Sinofsky and Woody Allen. Epstein then told Brock Pierce: "had bobby kotick here for dinner last night, heard lots about the future." The "teams of experts" framing recurs across Epstein's social operation — assembling intellectually impressive gatherings to cultivate relationships with wealthy and powerful figures.

### 4. The Connector Network

The corpus shows Steve Tisch facilitating Epstein's access to LA entertainment figures through Kotick. Tisch suggests: "Kotick should invite him to meet you" (referring to Brian Grazer). Epstein's Google Calendar lists "People to see in LA: Slayton, Sophie, Josephson, Elon, Kotick, Tisch" — revealing how Epstein organized social campaigns around geographic trips.

### 5. What Kotick Declined

The corpus also documents what Kotick turned down:
- The Thanksgiving 2012 island visit ("I think we are going right to Virgin Gorda")
- Three separate hacker conference invitations in Las Vegas (May, July x2 2013)
- The ranch in Santa Fe

These declinations, alongside acceptances of NYC dinners and Beverly Hills drinks, suggest Kotick maintained the relationship on his own terms — primarily in his home territory of Los Angeles and during New York visits.

## Methodology

All quotes are transcribed directly from OCR'd text in the EFTA corpus via FTS5 search and page-level extraction from `full_text_corpus.db`. Dataset assignments are verified against the `documents` table. OCR artifacts (e.g., "woody alien" for "Woody Allen") are noted but not corrected in direct quotes. Every factual claim is tied to a specific EFTA number with a working justice.gov link.

Total corpus presence: 308 documents, 320 pages. Search terms: `kotick`, `bobby kotick`, `Kotick Bobby`.
