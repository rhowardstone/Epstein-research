## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

On August 21, 2002 at 11:22 PM, Jeffrey Epstein dialed 911 from 358 El Brillo Way, Palm Beach, Florida. The Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) system logged the call as type 088 — SICK PERSON/FIRST AID. A single police unit responded. No narrative was recorded, no fire rescue or EMS was dispatched, and the call was explicitly disposed as "No Report" (code 021). The call record exists in five separate copies across three EFTA datasets plus the House Oversight production, all consistent in their content — and all consistent in what they lack.

This report documents two structural anomalies and one notable disposition in the CAD record for this call, and places them in the context of the complete dispatch history at 358 El Brillo Way. It does not speculate about who was ill, what the responding officer observed, or why no further documentation exists. The records do not support such conclusions; that is itself the finding.

**Source:** DOJ-OGR-00031174, pages 7 and 37 (the document contains two complete copies of the dispatch history; pages 6 and 36 are folder dividers labeled "CAD CALLS"). Also confirmed in [EFTA01333459](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01333459.pdf) page 6, [EFTA02729035](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02729035.pdf) page 1, and [EFTA00260438](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00260438.pdf).

### 1.2 Key Observations

**Caller:** Jeffrey Epstein called personally. The phone number 561-655-7629 appears on multiple household documents as Epstein's primary Palm Beach line. The source is listed as "911" — not a non-emergency line, not a third-party relay.

**Call Taker and Dispatcher:** Both functions were handled by the same person, Wendy Dunn (badge 0000008465). This is not inherently unusual for late-night shifts but means there was no independent dispatcher overseeing unit allocation.

**Response Time:** 8 minutes and 42 seconds from receipt to arrival (23:22:45 → 23:31:27). The Palm Beach Police Department station at 345 South County Road is approximately 0.3 miles from 358 El Brillo Way.

**Responding Officer:** The officer's name reads "IRION, DON" in the clearest image rendering (DOJ-OGR-00031210, page 37). OCR variants include "TRION, DON" (DOJ-OGR-00031180), "IRIO$, DON" ([EFTA02729035](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02729035.pdf)), and "TRPON, DON" (DOJ-OGR-00031174 OCR text). This officer does not appear on any other call at 358 El Brillo Way in the complete CAD history.

---

## PART 2: THREE FINDINGS

### Finding 1: No Narrative

The CAD system used by Palm Beach PD includes a narrative function (accessed via F11 on the call screen). In the complete CAD dispatch history at 358 El Brillo Way — contained in DOJ-OGR-00031174 — every other call has a narrative page immediately following the call record. These narratives document what was found on scene, what actions were taken, and any relevant details.

For call 022330228, no narrative exists. In the document, page 7 (and page 37 in the second section) shows the call record; the next page jumps directly to the next chronological call. This pattern does not occur with any other call in the document.

For comparison, here are the narratives recorded for other calls at the same address:

| Date | Call Type | Narrative Content |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| **8/21/02** | **088 SICK PERSON/FIRST AID** | **[No narrative]** |
| 11/28/04 | 093 Suspicious Vehicle | "veh in his driveway/unsure type of veh... he drives a blk suburban/leaving now... veh is the company he was expecting" |
| 2/02/05 | 008 Alarm/Burg-Intrusion | "203 was 10-12 with the caretaker giayano/everything is fine... aud/entry door/female on premise, luella" |
| 2/07/05 | 143 CAD File Check | "update cad file" |
| 3/26/05 | 069 Open Door | "house should be 10-7, open door to guest... caretaker is leaving from the police station and will meet the officer at the house" |
| 8/04/05 | 008 Alarm/Burg-Intrusion | "called alrm co/they spoke to rep/not responding... aud/masterbedroom/655 7626/epstein" |
| 9/09/05 | 005 Accident/Hit & Run | "neg inj, neg desc for other 1/2... veh was parked outside 10-20, veh was un-occd" |

**Source for all:** DOJ-OGR-00031174, pages 7–19 (first section) and pages 37–49 (second section).

A CAD file update to change administrative metadata warranted a narrative entry. A parked car being hit in the driveway warranted a narrative entry. A late-night 911 call for a sick person did not.

### Finding 2: No Fire Rescue / EMS Dispatch

Call type 088 — SICK PERSON/FIRST AID — is a medical call category. In Florida's dual-dispatch protocol, medical calls typically generate both a law enforcement and a fire rescue/EMS response. The CAD record for call 022330228 shows only one unit dispatched: police unit 301, assigned to Officer Don Irion.

No fire rescue unit number appears anywhere in the record. No EMS transport is documented. No hospital destination is recorded.

The Epstein household maintained an emergency contact sheet (found in six copies across five sources: [EFTA02729006](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02729006.pdf), [EFTA01257329](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01257329.pdf), [EFTA00257343](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00257343.pdf), [EFTA01720967](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01720967.pdf), [EFTA00007893](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00007893.pdf), and [HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014118](https://archive.org/download/Epstein_Estate_Documents_-_Seventh_Production/IMAGES/002/HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014118.jpg)). This sheet lists:

- **FIRE RESCUE:** (561) 838-5422
- **HOSPITAL:** Good Samaritan Hospital, 1309 North Flagler Drive, West Palm Beach

The existence of fire rescue and hospital contacts on the household's own emergency reference sheet confirms these services were known to and expected by the household. Their absence from a 911 sick-person call is notable.

### Finding 3: Disposition 021 — No Report Filed

The disposition field for call 022330228 reads `021 No Rpt/TOT` — code 021, meaning "No Report / Turned Over To." This is not a blank or missing field; it is an explicit classification confirming that no police report was filed for this call.

For comparison, here are the dispositions for all other calls at 358 El Brillo Way:

| Date | Call Type | Disposition |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **8/21/02** | **088 SICK PERSON/FIRST AID** | **021 No Rpt/TOT** |
| 11/28/04 | 093 Suspicious Vehicle | (resolved per narrative) |
| 2/02/05 | 008 Alarm/Burg-Intrusion | 034 Human Error |
| 3/26/05 | 069 Open Door | 022 No Rpt/Asmt, Comp |
| 8/04/05 | 008 Alarm/Burg-Intrusion | 036 Weather Related |
| 9/09/05 | 005 Accident/Hit & Run | 022 No Rpt/Asmt Comp |

Two other calls — the Open Door and the Accident — also carry "No Report" dispositions (code 022). However, both of those calls have narrative entries documenting what was found. The 911 sick-person call is the only entry in the complete dispatch history with a no-report disposition AND no narrative: the officer arrived, coded the call as "no report," and left zero documentation of what he observed.

The "TOT" suffix — "Turned Over To" — raises the additional question of whether the call was referred to another agency or individual, but no such referral is documented.

## PART 3: TIMELINE CONTEXT

The midnight call of August 21, 2002 falls within a period that is now extensively documented across the EFTA corpus.

### 3.1 The First Investigation (December 2001 – April 2002)

Four months before the 911 call, the Palm Beach Police Department's Organized Crime, Vice and Narcotics (OCVAN) unit had already investigated 358 El Brillo Way and closed its case.

The OCVAN Case Report (Case 2002-10, "Prostitution-Epstein") documents the following timeline:

- **December 6, 2001:** OCVAN received intelligence from West Palm Beach PD concerning Ghislaine Maxwell recruiting young women from Palm Beach Atlantic College (PBAC) to "answer phones" at 358 El Brillo Way for $200/day.
- **December 10, 2001:** The report documented that "at least two of the girls complained about Epstein touching them inappropriately."
- **January 28 – April 16, 2002:** Intermittent trash pulls at 358 El Brillo Way yielded "nude photographs of women," "numerous references to massages through daily calendars, phone messages," "individual directory listings for massages in New York, and the United Kingdom," and a list titled "People that I want you to meet" listing "females, ages, descriptions, and what they do."
- **April 24, 2002:** Two witnesses confirmed they had been approached by Maxwell and "had worked at the residence briefly answering phones, and were paid well."
- **April 25, 2002:** A third witness described "nude photographs of women all over the residence" and "women running around the pool area topless, and that people were always getting massages." She stated Epstein had asked her "to take her top off for the massage."
- **Case Status:** UNFOUNDED.

**Source:** [EFTA01308891](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01308891.pdf)–[EFTA01308894](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01308894.pdf) (DS10), with copies at [EFTA01334281](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01334281.pdf), [EFTA00022654](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022654.pdf), [EFTA00077923](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00077923.pdf), [EFTA00090685](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00090685.pdf), [EFTA01699235](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01699235.pdf).

The case report itself notes: "Although it appears as though unusual activity is occurring at this residence, at this time, no illegal activity has been reported or detected. This information will remain as intelligence purposes only."

### 3.2 Ongoing Activity at 358 El Brillo (2001–2003)

The grand jury affidavit states: "Jane Doe estimates that she returned to Epstein's home approximately 100 times between 2001 and 2003. Epstein masturbated in Jane Doe's presence during all but three of the massages she provided." ([EFTA01718828](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01718828.pdf))

The federal indictments charge that the conspiracy ran "from at least as early as 2001" through 2005, and document sexual activity with a 17-year-old in the presence of a 14-year-old "in the beginning of 2001." ([EFTA01659794](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01659794.pdf), [EFTA01659911](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01659911.pdf), [EFTA01660122](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660122.pdf))

FedEx invoices on account 1144-2081.6 from Dataset 10 show packages shipped from Palm Beach (zip 33480) from December 2001 through at least October 2002. John Alessi, identified in the burglary report and other records as the house manager at 358 El Brillo Way, was associated with the household during this period. ([EFTA01313271](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01313271.pdf), [EFTA01313340](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01313340.pdf), [EFTA01313357](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01313357.pdf), [EFTA01313516](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01313516.pdf), [EFTA01313762](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01313762.pdf))

### 3.3 Later Known Occupants (October 2003)

A burglary report filed on October 5, 2003 (Case 1-03-001498, DOJ-OGR-00030998, pages 43–45) lists the house guests and employees present at 358 El Brillo Way at that time:

**House Guests:**
- Nada Narcinkova (Slovakia)
- Teala Davies (described as "massage therapist" from California)

**Live-in Employees:**
- Michael Friedman
- Rosilee Friedman
- Chef Valdwon Cotrin

The report also references Juan Patricio Alessi Munoz (the house manager).

**Source:** [DOJ-OGR-00030998](https://epstein-data.com/full_text_corpus/pages?efta_number=DOJ-OGR-00030998), page 43.

### 3.4 The Probable Cause Affidavit

The same 135-page document containing the CAD records (DOJ-OGR-00031174) opens with the Probable Cause Affidavit for Case 05-368(2), Defendant Haley Robson. This affidavit, sworn September 20, 2005, by Detective Joe Recarey, describes the recruitment of a 14-year-old victim to 358 El Brillo Way and documents the pattern that would eventually lead to Epstein's arrest. The affidavit quotes Robson stating that when she tried to bring a 23-year-old woman, "Epstein stated that the female was too old," and that Epstein told her "the younger the better."

**Source:** [DOJ-OGR-00031174](https://epstein-data.com/full_text_corpus/pages?efta_number=DOJ-OGR-00031174), pages 1–5.

## PART 4: OTHER MEDICAL REFERENCES IN THE CORPUS

### 4.1 Fire Department Transport

One separate incident in the corpus documents a victim being "transported to the hospital by Royal Palm Beach Fire Department" with allegations of forced sex and a rape kit administered by Dr. Michael Zappa. Victim Services Counselor/Advocate Patricia Badu-Tweneboah was dispatched. This incident (1997, Royal Palm Beach jurisdiction) involves a different address, but demonstrates that fire rescue/EMS transport for sensitive incidents at Palm Beach County residences does generate documentation.

**Source:** [EFTA02691091](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02691091.pdf), [EFTA01165900](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01165900.pdf)

---

## PART 5: WHAT THE RECORD DOES NOT SHOW

This investigation searched the full text corpus (2.77 million pages across all 14 datasets) for any documentation of what occurred during this 911 call. The following searches returned no relevant results:

- No Palm Beach Fire Rescue dispatch records for 358 El Brillo Way on August 21, 2002
- No hospital admission or EMS transport records for that date
- No police incident report or supplemental report referencing call 022330228
- No narrative page for this call in any of the five copies across four datasets
- No reference to the responding officer (in any OCR variant: IRION, TRION, IRIO$, TRPON) in any other EFTA document beyond this CAD record

The phone number associated with the call (561-655-7629) is confirmed as Epstein's primary Palm Beach line in the household emergency contact sheets and other documents. The address is confirmed as Epstein's primary Palm Beach residence. The call was placed via 911.

Beyond these facts, the CAD record is a closed system. It documents that a sick-person call occurred, that an officer was dispatched, that he arrived, that the call was coded as "no report," and that no further record was created. The identity of the sick person, the nature of the illness, and the outcome of the officer's response are not documented anywhere in the 2.73 million pages of the EFTA production.

## METHODOLOGY

This report was produced through systematic querying of the EFTA full text corpus (6.3 GB, 1,385,879 documents, 2,770,154 pages) and the concordance database (729 MB, 1.38 million rows). All five copies of the CAD record were cross-referenced to resolve OCR artifacts. The complete 135-page CAD history document (DOJ-OGR-00031174) was read in full to establish the baseline for narrative presence across all logged calls. Original page images were inspected to verify data points where OCR was ambiguous.

All documents cited are available through the DOJ's EFTA production at [justice.gov/epstein](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/) or through the House Oversight production at [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/@us_house_judiciary_committee).

No conclusions are drawn about the identity of the person who was ill, the reason for the missing narrative, or the decisions made by the responding officer or dispatcher. The data is presented as found.
