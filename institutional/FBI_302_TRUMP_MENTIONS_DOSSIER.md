## PART 1: SWORN FD-302 WITNESS TESTIMONY

These are formal FBI interview reports — witnesses and victims speaking to FBI agents, memorialized in FD-302 format. This is the most probative category.

### 1A. Flight Records and Physical Presence

**Larry Visoski (Epstein's Chief Pilot) — FD-302, 01/27/2006**
[EFTA00159473](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00159473.pdf) (DS9) | Also: [EFTA00162520](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00162520.pdf), [EFTA01688646](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01688646.pdf)

> *"As a practical joke, Epstein asked Visoski to purchase a box of condoms to place on Donald Trump's seat after he found out Trump's girlfriend was pregnant."*

Trump flew on Epstein's aircraft. Epstein placed condoms on Trump's seat as a joke after learning Trump's girlfriend (Melania Knauss, married 2005; Barron born March 2006) was pregnant.

---

**David Rodgers (Epstein's Second Pilot) — FD-302, 02/07/2020**
[EFTA00159180](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00159180.pdf) (DS9), page 9

> *"January 5, 1997 - Flight 934. Passengers included EPSTEIN, MAXWELL, DONALD TRUMP, MARK EPSTEIN, DIDIER who was a chef."*

One documented Trump flight in the Rodgers FD-302 review. Passengers: Epstein, Maxwell, Trump, Mark Epstein, and a chef named Didier.

---

**Larry Morrison (Aircraft Maintenance) — Deposition, read into FBI record**
[EFTA01247021](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01247021.pdf) (DS9)

> *Q: "Have you ever met Donald Trump?" A: "Yes... He boarded the airplane one day when ours was on the ramp." Q: "And did he fly on the plane?" A: "No." ... "Donald Trump was never on the airplane when I was on the airplane."*

Morrison's testimony contradicts the Visoski/Rodgers accounts — he says Trump never flew on the plane when Morrison was aboard. This doesn't preclude other flights.

---

**Mark Epstein (Jeffrey's Brother) — Deposition, 09/21/2009**
[EFTA01249325](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01249325.pdf) (DS9)

> *Q: "Have you ever met Donald Trump?" A: "Yes." Q: "Was that through your brother?" A: "Yes." ... "We flew up on my brother's plane from Florida together. Donald was on the plane." Q: "When?" A: "Somewhere between 5 and 10 years ago... late '90s early 2000." ... "They were friends."*

---

**House Manager (Juan Alessi) — FD-302, 02/19/2020**
[EFTA00091924](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00091924.pdf) (DS9)

> *"[Witness] recalled seeing many different people at EPSTEIN's home, including senators, PRINCE ANDREW, DONALD TRUMP, ROBERT KENNEDY, mathematicians, and many others."*

---

### 1B. Maxwell Introducing Women to Trump

Multiple victims describe a pattern: Ghislaine Maxwell introducing them to Trump in a manner similar to how she introduced women to Epstein.

**Victim FD-302, 07/27/2021 — Serial 631**
[EFTA00158676](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00158676.pdf) (DS9), page 6

> *"MAXWELL took [her] to a party in New York. MAXWELL seemed very excited that there would be a lot of great men for [her] to meet. [She] felt that MAXWELL presented her and gave a run down of [her] accolades, similar to a CV. MAXWELL presented [her] to TRUMP and they had a conversation for approximately 20 minutes. [She] was invited to MAR-A-LAGO where she was given a tour by TRUMP with EPSTEIN and MAXWELL present. Nothing happened between [her] and TRUMP. By the things that MAXWELL said, it was made clear that [she] was available. MAXWELL said things like, 'Oh I think he likes you. Aren't you lucky. This is great.'"*

> *"MAXWELL said things like, 'Oh he'll like that. He doesn't like that.' It was set up very much like how MAXWELL introduced [her] to EPSTEIN."*

The victim explicitly states "nothing happened" with Trump. She was approximately 20–22 at the time. But she describes Maxwell's presentation pattern as identical to the Epstein introduction method.

---

**Victim FD-302, 09/19/2019**
[EFTA00158645](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00158645.pdf) (DS9)

> *"[She] recalled meeting TRUMP at a party while with MAXWELL. MAXWELL told TRUMP, 'This is who I was telling you about.'"*

Brief mention within a detailed interview about Epstein/Maxwell abuse. No allegation against Trump.

---

**Victim FD-302, 09/02/2021 — Serial 632**
[EFTA00158697](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00158697.pdf) (DS9)

> *"Prior to all of this is when MAXWELL introduced [her] to TRUMP in New York."*

---

**Victim FD-302, 08/27/2019**
[EFTA00158636](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00158636.pdf) (DS9)

> *"EPSTEIN and MAXWELL introduced [her] to DONALD TRUMP. TRUMP was polite to [her]. [She] was approximately 20-22 years old."*

No allegation of misconduct. Victim was an adult.

---

### 1C. Allegations Involving Minors

**Victim Associate FD-302, 09/02/2021 — Serial 636** *(secondhand)*
[EFTA00158466](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00158466.pdf) (DS9), page 3

> *"[She] tells [the witness] that she met DONALD TRUMP when she was with EPSTEIN when she was about 15 years old. EPSTEIN says to TRUMP 'Oh she's a good one right' to which TRUMP responded 'Yeah'. This happened at Mar-A-Lago. [She] says that TRUMP was a regular visitor at EPSTEIN's. [She] also says 'Prince Albert' was there a lot as well."*

This is **secondhand** — the interviewee is relaying what a victim told them. The alleged victim was approximately 15.

---

**Victim FD-302, 04/11/2019**
[EFTA00096192](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00096192.pdf) (DS9) | Also: [EFTA01247196](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01247196.pdf)

> *"[She] knew that he knew DONALD TRUMP, because he went to a function that TRUMP was holding and told [her] that he would have taken her if she was 18."*

Epstein told the victim he attended a Trump event and said he would have brought her if she were 18. This is the victim relaying Epstein's words — it describes Epstein's thinking, not Trump's conduct.

---

**Civil Complaint in FBI Case File (Doe v. Epstein)**
[EFTA00019101](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019101.pdf) (DS8)

> *"During one of Doe's encounters with Epstein, he took her to Mar-a-Lago where he introduced her to its owner, Donald J. Trump. Introducing 14-year-old Doe to Donald J. Trump, Epstein elbowed Trump playfully asking him, referring to Doe, 'This is a good one, right?' Trump smiled and nodded in agreement."*

This is a **civil complaint** (not sworn testimony), included in the FBI case file. The language mirrors the secondhand account in EFTA00158466 — likely the same alleged victim.

---

### 1D. Explicit Denials

**Victim FD-302, 02/27/2020**
[EFTA00158500](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00158500.pdf) (DS9), page 13

> *"[She] was asked about if she was aware of a DONALD TRUMP allegation of sexual abuse. [She] stated no. There was some [redacted] saying that she was a victim of TRUMP but this was not true."*

The FBI directly asked this victim about a Trump allegation. She denied it.

---

**Attorney Bradley Edwards — Affidavit**
[HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013463](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2099/HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013463.pdf) (DS99)

> *"While research by other plaintiffs' attorneys and myself has uncovered other persons that were acquaintances of Mr. Epstein, specifically Donald Trump, Alan Dershowitz, Bill Clinton, Tommy Mottola, and David Copperfield, we have no information that any of those people (other than Mr. Dershowitz) have spoken to Mr. Epstein about Jane Doe or any of the other specific victims."*

---

### 1E. The Mar-a-Lago Recruitment

This is the most widely documented single narrative — a victim recruited by Maxwell while working at Mar-a-Lago. It appears in **13+ copies** across the production because the same FD-302 was embedded in multiple court filings.

[EFTA00208128](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00208128.pdf), [EFTA00210958](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00210958.pdf), [EFTA00269896](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00269896.pdf), [EFTA01248965](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01248965.pdf), and others

> *"In approximately June 1998 or 1999, [she] began working at Donald Trump's Mar-A-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida. [Her] father worked at Mar-A-Lago as a maintenance supervisor... [She] was reading an anatomy/massage book and was approached by GHISLAINE MAXWELL at Mar-A-Lago."*

Trump is mentioned only as the owner of Mar-a-Lago — the *setting* where recruitment occurred. No allegation against Trump.

---

### 1F. The Trump Photo — Serial 3501.045

**Victim FD-302, 07/24/2019 — Serial 216**
[EFTA01245620](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01245620.pdf) (DS9, 9 pages)

> *"[Administrative Note: [The victim] agreed to allow the Agents to take a photograph of the cropped image... the particular image sent to her by [friend] was recognized by Agents as a widely distributed photograph of JEFFREY EPSTEIN and current United States President DONALD TRUMP. The cropped image [the victim] provided to the Agents only included JEFFREY EPSTEIN.]"*

The victim identified Epstein from a cropped photo as "JEFF," the man who sexually abused her from age ~13. The uncropped image showed Trump. The victim had deliberately cropped Trump out.

**This is the sole published 302 for serial 3501.045. Three additional FBI interviews of this victim (June 7, August 20, October 16 2019) are listed in the prosecution disclosure index but are NOT in the published files.** See the [Missing FBI 302s dossier](FBI_302_MISSING_SERIALS_DOSSIER.md).

---

### 1G. Operational Connections

**Richard Barnett (Epstein's Chief Engineer, 18 years) — FD-302, 08/08/2019**
[EFTA01245364](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01245364.pdf) (DS9)

> *"BARNETT stated that he applied for the TRUMP organization for a chief engineer job and was referred to EPSTEIN for and up and coming project at 71st street... BARNETT stated that he met MAXWELL at the Trump Organization and via MAXWELL, BARNETT got the job with EPSTEIN."*

Barnett was referred from the Trump Organization to Epstein's mansion project. He met Maxwell at Trump Organization offices.

---

**Witness — FD-302, 06/19/2020 and 01/13/2021 — Serials 551 and 556**
[EFTA01245428](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01245428.pdf) and [EFTA01245431](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01245431.pdf) (DS9)

> *"She received death threats when she did not want to go meet TRUMP. The threats consisted of the men saying that they knew where she worked and could find her."*

This witness worked at a store in Trump Tower. She was approached by men she later connected to Epstein. In a follow-up interview:

> *"[She] wanted to know why nothing was being done in regards to the information she provided about DONALD TRUMP... had a friend in Florida who used to see JEFFREY EPSTEIN and DONALD TRUMP together all of the time... stated TRUMP was actively recruiting girls, whether it was for him or EPSTEIN she did not know."*

---

**Proffer Session — FD-302, 07/12/2019**
[EFTA00090773](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00090773.pdf) (DS9)

> *"EPSTEIN introduced MELANIA TRUMP to DONALD TRUMP. EPSTEIN was visiting ZEMPOLI at the agency when there were casting auditions for models."*

A witness states Epstein introduced Melania to Trump via model agent Paolo Zempoli.

---

**Victim/Witness — FD-302, date unclear**
[EFTA01249608](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01249608.pdf) (DS9)

> *"Epstein then called Trump and had a conversation with him while he was on the massage table. Epstein told her he managed Trump's, Bill Gate's and Victoria Secret's money. However, [she] does not know if this is true."*

---

**Victim — Transcript (recorded interview)**
[EFTA01249188](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01249188.pdf) (DS9)

> *"[She] and the other girls, along with Epstein and Maxwell, went to Mar-a-Lago, shake hands with President Donald Trump and his wife Melania and with Regis Philbin and his wife, as well."*

---

**Receptionist — FD-302, date unclear**
[EFTA01249579](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01249579.pdf) (DS9)

> *"[She] remembers the identity of some of the individuals in contact with Epstein, including Donald Trump's office, and the Duchess of York Sarah Ferguson."*

---

### 1H. The Epstein Deposition — Fifth Amendment

**Deposition of Jeffrey Epstein, 03/17/2010**
[EFTA00081220](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00081220.pdf) (DS9) | Multiple copies in production

> *Q: "Have you ever had a personal relationship with Donald Trump?"*
> *A: "Yes, sir."*
> *Q: "Have you socialized with him?"*
> *A: "Yes, sir."*
> *Q: "Have you ever socialized with Donald Trump in the presence of females under the age of 18?"*
> *A: [Invokes Fifth Amendment]*

Epstein gave identical Fifth Amendment responses for Dershowitz, Mottola, and Copperfield.

---

### 1I. Deutsche Bank Compliance

**Cherie Quigley (Deutsche Bank) — FD-302, 10/10/2019**
[EFTA00128968](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00128968.pdf) (DS9)

> *"QUIGLEY also noted DONALD TRUMP (TRUMP) became a covered client, which meant special access was required to view the profile."*

---

**Tammy Hill-McFadden (Deutsche Bank) — FD-302, 07/12/2019**
[EFTA00128987](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00128987.pdf) (DS9)

> *"HILL-MCFADDEN also reviewed TRUMP'S old post office portfolio cases. Since the DEUTSCHE systems did not talk to each other, she was unable to determine a sound origin of the funds."*

---

### 1J. "Prominent Names" — FBI Internal Summary

**FBI Analyst Summary, August 2025**
[EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf) (DS10)

An internal FBI document compiling allegations from a cellmate interview source. The Trump section:

> *"1. [Redacted] stated Epstein introduced her to Trump who subsequently forced her head down to his exposed penis which she subsequently bit. In response, Trump punched her in the head and kicked her out. (date range 1983-1985. [Victim] would have been 13-15)"*
>
> *"2. [Redacted] remember Epstein introduced her to Trump saying 'This is a good one, huh' and Trump responded 'Yes'. (date range roughly 1984. [Name] would have been 14)"*

This is an FBI summary document, not direct testimony. It compiles allegations from a cellmate interview (a secondhand source of secondhand claims). The document also lists allegations against Weinstein, Prince Andrew, Dubin, Staley, Black, Wexner, Dershowitz, Clinton, Lutnick, and Barr.

---

## PART 2: FBI CONFIDENTIAL HUMAN SOURCE (CHS) REPORTING

**FD-1023, Source S-00099701, 10/16/2020 — Los Angeles Field Office**
[EFTA00090314](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00090314.pdf) (DS9)

This is a classified (originally SECRET//NOFORN) intelligence report from a confidential human source. Key claims:

> *"CHS remembered Dershowitz tell Alex Acosta (U.S. Attorney of Southern District of Florida at the time) that Epstein belonged to both U.S. and allied intelligence services."*

> *"CHS advised Chabad is doing everything they can to co-opt the Trump presidency."*

> *"On the day Trump was elected President, Ivanka Trump and Jared were at the gravesite of Rabbi Scheersom, who was the most powerful Rabbi in the Chabad network."*

> *"Leon Black owns the mercenary firm formerly known as Blackwater, now Constellis... Apollo also lent the Kushners $184 million while Kushner was facing his 666 5th Avenue disaster."*

> CHS reported that Trump has been *"compromised by Israel, and Kushner is the real brains behind his organization and his Presidency."*

**NOTE**: This is a single CHS report. CHS intelligence is unverified — it represents what a source told the FBI, not what the FBI confirmed. The Leon Black / Blackwater claim is factually incorrect (Black's Apollo does not own Constellis/Blackwater — that's Erik Prince / Cerberus), which undermines the source's reliability.

---

## PART 3: EPSTEIN'S 2017 EMAILS

These show Epstein discussing Trump in personal correspondence well after his supposed social banishment.

**Epstein to Saudi Contact (Anas Alrasheed), 09/08-09/2017**
[EFTA02222388](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02222388.pdf) (DS11)

> Contact: *"tam just called mbs.. he want to sit and talk. breakthrough"*
> Contact: *"things look very bad in the gulf.. my feeling trump do not want to end it"*
> Epstein: *"I think trump cut the legs off your guy. He would like to take all the credit."*

Epstein discussing Trump and MBS (Mohammed bin Salman) with a Saudi contact in September 2017.

---

**Epstein Travel Coordination, 11/16-20/2017**
[EFTA02229828](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02229828.pdf), [EFTA02229932](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02229932.pdf), [EFTA02230152](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02230152.pdf), and others (DS11)

> Epstein to staff: *"trump is in town that week"*
> Pilot Visoski: *"While Trump is in PBI, TSA only allows arrival and departures between 8am and 5pm for General Aviation."*

Epstein tracking Trump's Palm Beach schedule and coordinating his own travel around it.

---

## PART 4: NTOC TIPS — CREDIBLE / PLAUSIBLE

These are tips from members of the public to the FBI's National Threat Operations Center. They are **unverified** but not facially absurd.

**Mar-a-Lago Party / "For Prostitutes" Warning**
[EFTA00020508](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020508.pdf) (DS8)

> Caller attended a party circa Christmas 2000. *"Someone told the party that Donald Trump had invited them all to a party at Mar a Lago."* Her companion Villeneuve told her *"it wasn't that kind of party, it was for prostitutes."*

The caller names specific people (Bobby Cox, Curt Schmidt / Blue Buffalo CEO, Villeneuve) and provides contextual details.

---

**Daughters Met Trump and "A Lady" in 1997**
[EFTA00020517](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020517.pdf) (DS8)

Caller reported that in 1997, a woman's daughters *"met a lady who invited her daughters... to a fancy hotel and met Donald Trump and some of his friends"* and kept asking how to spell "Ghislaine." Also:

> *"[He] drove a limo and picked up Trump in 1995. Trump continuously stated the name 'Jeffrey' while on the phone, and made references to 'abusing some girl.'"*

The caller then alleges the woman who told him this was found dead in Kiefer, OK with her *"head blown off"* — ruled suicide, officers disagreed.

**NOTE**: This is a single unverified tip. The limo driver claim is uncorroborated. The death allegation is checkable but unverified.

---

**Michael Capponi / Shuttle Buses**
[EFTA01244937](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01244937.pdf) (DS9)

> Anonymous tip about *"Michael Capponi sending shuttle busses full of underage models to Mar-a-Lago 'casting parties' during the time when Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump were partying together there in the 1990's."*

---

**William Engel / Instagram Post**
[EFTA01249263](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01249263.pdf) (DS9)

Anthony Cibelli reported that William Engel posted: *"Trump had a private line to Epstein. I know because I interviewed twice with Epstein to build his palatial home on his island."*

---

**Mark Epstein Tip, 02/22/2023**
[EFTA00038986](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038986.pdf) (DS8)

Jeffrey Epstein's own brother submitted: *"I believe Presient Trump authorized is murder."*

---

## PART 5: NTOC TIPS — CLEARLY NOT CREDIBLE

These tips contain claims that are facially absurd, internally contradictory, or contain fantastical elements that undermine credibility. They are included because they are in the FBI case file, but should be assessed accordingly.

---

**"Calendar Girl Auctions" and Mass Rape**
[EFTA01245100](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01245100.pdf) (DS9) — Online tip, 07/07/2020

> *"Donald Trump, the president, had parties at Maralago called 'calendar girls' Jeffrey Epstein would bring the children in and trump would auction them off.. he measured the children's vulva and vaginas by entering a finger.. rating the children on tightness... the guests were elder men.. and Elon Musk. Don jr. Ivanka and Eric were there."*

Submitted via tips.fbi.gov. IP resolved to **Acton, Ontario, Canada**. Claims Trump, Musk, Don Jr., Ivanka, and Eric were all present at child auctions. No corroboration in any other document in the production.

---

**Trump Golf Course Sex Trafficking Ring**
[EFTA01249502](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01249502.pdf) (DS9) — Online tip, 07/08/2020

> *"I am a victim and witness to a sex trafficking ring operating at the Trump Golf course in Racho Palos Verdes California during the years 1995-1996. The madam and broker for sex parties that included minors both male and female, was Ghislain Maxwell."*

Tipster claims Trump's head of security threatened: *"if I ever talked of what went on there or who I saw, That I would end up as fertilizer for the back nine holes like the other cunts."*

A follow-up call ([EFTA01249507](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01249507.pdf)) from apparently the same person claims to have *"recordings of Donald Trump, Jeffrey Epstein, and Ghislaine Maxwell discussing marketing strategies for high profile sex parties"* but mailed them *"to a lawyer in the Cayman Islands."* Also claims he *"was part of the Sinaloa Cartel and worked closely with Epstein and Maxwell."*

**The Sinaloa Cartel claim and the conveniently unproducible recordings in the Cayman Islands mark this as not credible.**

---

**Lake Michigan Murder / Newborn Disposed**
[EFTA00025010](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00025010.pdf) (DS8) — Online tip, 08/03/2020

> *"He participated regularly in paying money to force me to [redacted] with him and he was present when my uncle murdered my newborn child and disposed of the body in Lake Michigan."*

Tip from New Mexico. Claims abuse occurred *"from a yacht in Lake Michigan originating from Mona Lake, MI"* in 1984 when tipster was 13. Lists Trump (age 70) as a witness in Washington DC.

**The claim involves murder of a newborn and disposal in Lake Michigan. No corroboration.**

---

**"St. Jeffrey" Orgies**
[EFTA01249520](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01249520.pdf) (DS9)

> Tipster claimed she *"went to his 'St. Tomas island,' which he referred to as 'St. Jeffrey.' Epstein and other 'powerful' men, including Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, would have 'big orgy parties' with her, other young girls, and older Victoria's Secret models."*

Generic claim naming Clinton and Trump together at island orgies. No specific dates, locations, or verifiable details.

---

**Tapes / Recordings**
[EFTA00020493](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020493.pdf) (DS8) — NTOC call, 08/20/2020

> Caller claimed *"there were films of men who were recorded. These men are prominent figures such as Epstein, President Bill Clinton, and President Donald Trump. Maxwell is also on the tapes."*

Generic "tapes exist" claim. No specific details about content, location, or how the caller knows.

---

**Social Media Auto-Captures**
[EFTA01245068](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01245068.pdf), [EFTA01245072-01245075](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01245072.pdf) (DS9)

FBI's NTOC auto-captured tweets referencing the "Jane Doe" / "Katie Johnson" civil complaint (Case 1:16-cv-07673, S.D.N.Y.) alleging rape by Trump at Epstein's home in 1994. The civil suit was voluntarily dismissed. The tweets are from political accounts (@DougScott357, "NeverTrump" in bio) republishing the civil complaint allegations.

## PART 6: THE NTOC TRACKER — FBI Dispositions

**FBI NTOC Names Tracker with Dispositions**
[EFTA01660651](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660651.pdf), [EFTA01660679](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660679.pdf) (DS10)

These spreadsheets track FBI dispositions of every NTOC tip mentioning prominent names. For Trump-related tips:

| Tip Summary | FBI Disposition |
|-------------|----------------|
| Forced oral sex at age 13-14 in NJ, ~35 years ago | "Spoke with caller who identified [friend] as victim. Lead sent to Washington Office." |
| Mar-a-Lago party "for prostitutes" | "Spoken with twice. First time said she was a pilates instructor and went to Epstein's once." |
| School mad at her for not being a "Trump person" | Noted |
| Friend "Victim 1" at Trump Plaza, given drink, woke up naked with $300 (1987) | Noted |
| Trump Golf Course sex trafficking ring | Noted |
| Calendar girl auctions at Mar-a-Lago | Noted |
| Trump participated in paying for sex acts | Noted |

**Key observation**: Most tips were simply "noted." The forced oral sex allegation was the only one that generated an actual investigative lead (forwarded to Washington Field Office). The Mar-a-Lago party tip resulted in two follow-up contacts with the caller.

## Summary

### What the FBI Documents Show

1. **Trump flew on Epstein's plane** (Visoski, Rodgers, Mark Epstein — sworn testimony)
2. **Trump was seen at Epstein's home** (Alessi — sworn testimony)
3. **Maxwell introduced women to Trump** in a pattern victims described as similar to her Epstein introductions (at least 4 victims)
4. **Epstein confirmed socializing with Trump** and invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked about socializing with Trump "in the presence of females under the age of 18"
5. **One victim explicitly denied** a Trump abuse allegation
6. **One victim (age 20-22) explicitly stated** "nothing happened" between her and Trump
7. **Maxwell recruited a victim at Trump's Mar-a-Lago** (the most widely documented single narrative)
8. **Barnett was referred from the Trump Organization to Epstein** and met Maxwell at Trump Organization offices
9. **Epstein was still discussing Trump and geopolitics** with Saudi contacts in September 2017 and tracking Trump's Palm Beach schedule in November 2017
10. **Deutsche Bank had both Epstein and Trump as "covered clients"** requiring special compliance review

### What the FBI Tips Contain

A mix of plausible leads (the Mar-a-Lago party tip, the limo driver account) and clearly fantastic claims (calendar girl auctions with Elon Musk, Sinaloa Cartel connections, Lake Michigan infant murder). Most tips were "noted" without investigative follow-up. One generated an actual lead sent to the Washington Field Office.

### What Is Missing

Serial 3501.045 — the victim who identified Epstein from a photo that also showed Trump — has **3 of 4 FBI interview reports missing** from the published files. The interviews from June 7, August 20, and October 16 2019 are listed in the prosecution disclosure index but not in the EFTA production. See the [Missing FBI 302s dossier](FBI_302_MISSING_SERIALS_DOSSIER.md).
