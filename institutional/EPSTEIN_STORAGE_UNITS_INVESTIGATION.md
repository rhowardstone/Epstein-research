# Epstein's Storage Units: The Evidence the FBI Never Searched

## Executive Summary

Between October 7, 2005, and his death on August 10, 2019, Jeffrey Epstein maintained a network of at least seven commercial storage facilities across Florida, New York, and New Jersey. These units held computers removed from his Palm Beach mansion before a police search warrant was executed, nude photographs, telephone directories, sex toys, an 8mm tape with handwritten labels including "shower" and "lingerie," and an unknown quantity of other materials.

The computers were forensically cloned in July 2007 by **Dave Kleiman** — a Palm Beach computer forensics expert who would later become central to the Craig Wright / Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin controversy. The cloning produced 12 forensic copies. A federal grand jury subpoenaed the computers, but Epstein moved to quash the subpoena and never withdrew the motion — even though the Non-Prosecution Agreement required him to.

**No law enforcement agency — not the Palm Beach Police Department, not the FBI, and not the SDNY — ever executed a search warrant on any of these storage units.** The units are documented through credit card statements, invoices, email correspondence, and sworn declarations in the EFTA corpus. Separately, Ghislaine Maxwell maintained at least three additional storage units in River Edge, New Jersey, plus a high-end art storage unit at UOVO in Long Island City — also never searched.

Under Florida's Self-Storage Facility Act, unpaid units can be auctioned approximately 60 days after default. If no one continued paying after Epstein's death, the contents of the Florida units may have been sold or discarded as early as October 2019.

This report documents every storage facility identifiable in the corpus, the specific evidence they contained, the legal proceedings that should have compelled their search, and the merchant-level identifying details that could still be used to subpoena storage companies for current records.

## Part 1: The Pre-Warrant Computer Removal

### October 7, 2005 — Thirteen Days Before the Search Warrant

On October 7, 2005, private investigator **Paul Lavery** visited 358 El Brillo Way, Palm Beach, Florida — Jeffrey Epstein's mansion — and, "pursuant to the instructions of attorney Roy Black," removed over 100 items of "potential evidentiary value." The items were turned over to investigator **William Riley** of the firm **Riley Kiraly** for "inventory and safekeeping purposes."

Riley's four-page inventory memo to Roy Black, dated October 9, 2005, lists the following items removed from the residence ([EFTA01733753](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01733753.pdf)):

**Computers:**
- Dell Precision 650 — sn# BWCNM31
- Dell Dimension 4100 — sn# 8CTMD01
- HP Pavilion 752n — sn# MX228A0063

**Telephone directories:**
- 5 silver, 2 green, 6 orange, 16 blue/black bound directories (29 total)

**Photographs and recordings:**
- 1 metal HS 8mm tape with handwritten notations: *"some photos, flor exercises, two jokes, dancing, shower, lingerie, good-bye"*
- 3 printed pages titled "Individual Directory Listing — Massage - Florida"
- Multiple nude and partially nude photographs of white females
- 1 photograph inscribed: *"Jeffery, It's [name]. Better never forget about me. May 28 we'll be traveling, Love always, Class of 2005"*

**Sex-related materials:**
- "Compleat Slave — creating and living an erotic dominant/submissive lifestyle"
- "Training with Miss Abernathy — a workbook for erotic slaves and their owners"
- Multiple VHS tapes including "Cherry Poppers Crash Course Volume 9," "Cherry Poppers #15 Mischievous Maidens," "All Little Women #4," "Barely Legal," "Purely 18," and "Only 18"
- Multiple sex toys, handcuffs, vibrators, and restraints

**Other items:**
- Florida Concealed Weapons Permit (Epstein, exp. 03/29/2010)
- Harvard University Identification Card (Epstein)
- $2,256.00 in cash
- Desk tray containing pens, tape recorder, blank tape, and bullets

Thirteen days later, on October 20, 2005, Palm Beach Police executed a search warrant at the same residence. The police report documents what they found — and what they didn't find:

> *"It appeared as though a second computer had been recently removed as the cables ends from the monitor, keyboard and mouse were in the same area. A further search of the room revealed no media storage devices, i.e. CD's, Floppy Disks, Zip Disks, etc. This type of media is commonly stored in an area where computers are placed, yet no media was found."*

— Palm Beach Police Department Incident Report, Case No. 1-05-000368 ([EFTA01334241](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01334241.pdf))

The police found monitors with no computers, keyboards connected to nothing, and A/V capture cards with RCA jacks attached to a CPU that was disconnected from any display. One computer in the Kitchen Staff Office had its left side panel removed, exposing the hardware — powered off, unplugged. The surveillance system hard-wired into the home, which would have contained video footage of visitors, was gone.

Riley had already taken everything that mattered.

## Part 2: The Forensic Cloning — Dave Kleiman

### July 25-26, 2007

Nearly two years after the removal, the three computers were still in Riley's custody. Attorney Roy Black hired **David Kleiman**, a computer forensics expert based in Boca Raton, to create forensic images of all three machines.

A sworn declaration filed under seal in federal court (In Re Grand Jury Subpoenas FGJ 07-103, Duces Tecum Numbers OLY-63 and OLY-64) preserves the details. A Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office detective — an EnCase Certified Examiner who worked child exploitation cases — declared under penalty of perjury ([EFTA00222965](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00222965.pdf)):

> *"I received a phone call from David Kleiman on the morning of July 25, 2007. Mr. Kleiman advised me that he was hired by attorney Roy Black to make three bit-stream copies and one EnCase image for each of three computers."*

Kleiman asked to borrow the Sheriff's Office's hard drive duplication device. The detective declined — *"the Logicube machine he wanted to use was not reliable."* Kleiman instead purchased a device from Digital Intelligence and had it shipped overnight to his office in Boca Raton.

Key details from the declaration:

- Kleiman was *"former law enforcement"* who had *"assisted the Sheriff's Office in computer related examinations and seizures in the past"*
- The job *"needed to be done as soon as possible"*
- Kleiman was meeting *"a private investigator who worked with Mr. Black"* the next morning — described as *"an old-time New York cop-type"* (Riley or Lavery)
- The computers *"had not been used since 2005"* — confirming these were the El Brillo Way machines
- Kleiman estimated the process would take *"at least 10 hours or more"*
- Someone would be *"standing by while the process was being completed"*

**Total forensic copies created: 12** — three bit-stream copies and one EnCase image for each of three computers.

The detective relayed Kleiman's call to an FBI Special Agent over lunch that same day, July 25, 2007. The FBI knew that Epstein's defense team was forensically imaging the removed computers. An identical copy of this declaration also appears at [EFTA00178967](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00178967.pdf), p. 219.

### Who Was Dave Kleiman?

David Kleiman (January 22, 1967 — April 26, 2013) was a computer security and forensics pioneer. A former Palm Beach County Sheriff's detective, he co-authored the *Syngress* textbook series on computer forensics and helped establish the PBSO Computer Forensics Lab. A 1995 motorcycle accident left him wheelchair-bound; he subsequently worked as a freelance forensics consultant from Riviera Beach, Florida.

Kleiman died on April 26, 2013, from complications of MRSA — found in his home surrounded by handguns and alcohol bottles, with a gunshot wound that a medical examiner ruled was from a self-inflicted accidental discharge while bedridden.

He is most widely known for the **Kleiman v. Wright** lawsuit, in which his estate alleged that Kleiman was involved in the creation of Bitcoin alongside Craig Wright. The case, filed in 2018, centered on whether Kleiman and Wright had jointly mined approximately 1.1 million early Bitcoin. A jury in 2021 found Wright liable for $100 million in conversion.

**No outlet has publicly connected Kleiman's role in forensically cloning Jeffrey Epstein's computers with his later fame in the Bitcoin/Satoshi Nakamoto controversy.** The February 2026 reporting by The Telegraph, ABC News, and the Palm Beach Post mentions him only in passing as "a computer-forensics expert."

---

## Part 3: The Grand Jury Subpoenas That Were Never Complied With

The federal government issued **Grand Jury Subpoenas Duces Tecum OLY-63 and OLY-64** to compel production of the removed computer equipment. Epstein's attorneys filed a motion to quash.

AUSA Marie Villafana's January 29, 2008 email — part of the internal DOJ correspondence released as "Operation Leap Year" — lays out what happened ([EFTA01659971](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01659971.pdf)):

> *"Judge Marra originally prepared for the hearing on Epstein's motion to quash the subpoena for the computer equipment that was removed from his home in anticipation of the execution of a search warrant. We rescheduled the hearing several times for plea negotiations and, as part of the signed agreement, Epstein was supposed to withdraw the motion to quash, but never did."*

The Non-Prosecution Agreement was signed September 24, 2007. It required Epstein to withdraw the motion to quash. He never did. The hearing was continually postponed. There is no evidence in the corpus that the three computers or any of the 12 forensic copies were ever produced to the government.

A civil subpoena was also issued directly to **Paul A. Lavery** in *Epstein v. Edwards*, demanding ([EFTA01713206](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01713206.pdf)):

> *"1. All computer equipment and electronic storage media removed from the residence located at 358 El Brillo Way, Palm Beach, Florida... 2. All computer equipment and electronic storage media that currently belongs to, or has ever belonged to, Jeffrey Epstein... 3. All documents and information related to the nature of the relationship between Mr. William Riley and/or Riley Kiraly and Mr. Jeffrey Epstein..."*

---

## Part 4: "I Have Them Locked in Storage"

### August 23, 2009

Nearly four years after the removal and two years after the cloning, Riley still had the computers. On August 23, 2009, he emailed **Robert D. Critton Jr.** (Epstein's civil litigation attorney at Burman, Critton, Luttier & Coleman), with copies to **Jessica Cadwell** (a paralegal at the firm), **Roy Black**, and **Jeffrey Epstein** ([EFTA00884246](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00884246.pdf)):

> *"Bob, Over the weekend I learned that plaintiff's counsel are looking to get from me the computers and paperwork I took from Jeff's house prior to the Search Warrant. I have them locked in storage and would like to know what to do with them. They are no longer needed in the criminal case, I assume. Is it possible to give you these items for your review and safekeeping or give it to Darren Indyke or back to Jeff, etc.?"*

Page 2 of the email continues:

> *"I have attached my inventory and some of the photos of the items I have. Roy Black directed that the computers drives be cloned and he would have the results of that effort. The cloning was done by a forensic specialist, Dave Kleiman."*

Epstein forwarded Riley's email first to Roy Black, then to **Martin Weinberg**, his criminal defense attorney.

Riley's storage location for the computers at this time was **Manhattan Mini Storage** in New York City. His invoices to Critton's firm confirm $490/month for "New York Storage facility" beginning no later than November 2009 ([EFTA00612018](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00612018.pdf)).

---

## Part 5: The Court Preservation Order

On an unspecified date in 2009, the court in the civil litigation issued a preservation order that explicitly covered storage units. The order, responding to a motion from Jane Doe plaintiffs, directed ([EFTA00728870](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00728870.pdf)):

> *"Specifically, Defendant must preserve the following evidence: records of phone communications; records of domestic and international travel... any evidence stored in Defendant's storage unit; all photographs of the interior and exterior of Defendant's Palm Beach mansion as it appeared in 1998 through October 2005... and all computers used by Defendant and/or his agents and/or employees during 1998 through and including October 25, 2005, the date of the search warrant."*

A separate litigation hold letter from opposing counsel to **Robert D. Critton, Esq.** demanded preservation of *"a complete, bit-by-bit 'mirror' evidentiary image copy of the storage media of each and every personal computer"* — targeting the very Kleiman forensic clones ([EFTA00614372](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00614372.pdf)).

This preservation order remains legally binding. If the estate executors, Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn, allowed storage units containing court-ordered preserved evidence to lapse, that is a violation of the order.

## Part 6: The Storage Unit Map

The EFTA corpus contains American Express credit card statements (account ending 2-61005), UBS business account records, and email correspondence that identify the following storage facilities. Merchant descriptor details, store numbers, and phone numbers are included because they are **subpoenable identifiers** that could be used to determine the current status of each unit.

### Unit 5: Manhattan Mini Storage — New York, NY

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Location** | Manhattan, New York (specific address unknown) |
| **Monthly cost** | $490.00 + 7% FL service tax = $524.30/month |
| **Period documented** | November 2009 — October 2010+ |
| **Paid by** | Epstein, via intermediary "Jack," then via Critton/HBRK |
| **Renter** | William Riley / Riley Kiraly |

This was Riley's unit — the one where the three computers, 29 telephone directories, photographs, 8mm tape, and other items removed from El Brillo Way were held. Riley invoiced Critton's firm for "New York Storage facility" at $490/month ([EFTA00612018](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00612018.pdf)).

In September 2010, Riley asked Epstein to take over billing directly:

> *"Would you get your accountant to send me credit card information so I can have it put on file to have the monthly charges at Manhattan Mini Storage billed directly to your card."*

— [EFTA00757442](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00757442.pdf)

Richard Kahn responded: *"$2,000 was sent to Jack on August 5th to pay for May-August 2010 Storage fees. Funds were sent to Jack on August 30th to pay for September and October 2010 Storage fees."* ([EFTA02422842](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02422842.pdf))

Manhattan Mini Storage operates over 30 locations across Manhattan. The specific facility has not been identified from the corpus documents.

### Unit 6: Extra Space Storage #0804 — River Edge, NJ (Maxwell)

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Store number** | 0804 |
| **Location** | River Edge, New Jersey |
| **Phone** | (201) 996-0020 |
| **Merchant reference** | 5600000111240 |
| **Monthly total** | $1,000-$1,200 across multiple units |
| **Period in corpus** | January 2016 — November 2016 |
| **Paid by** | Ghislaine Maxwell, via UBS debit (116 East 65th Street LLC) and ELLMAX LLC AmEx |

This facility was paid from **two separate Maxwell-controlled accounts**:

**A. UBS Business Services Account** for **116 East 65th Street LLC** (Financial Advisors: Scott Stack / Lyle Casriel). Cardholder: "G MAXWELL." Charges appear on pages 51-72 of [EFTA01277957](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01277957.pdf).

Sample charges from February 2016:
- Feb 13: $366.31 — `0804 EXTRA SPACE ST0 201-996-0020 NJ`
- Feb 22: $257.82 — `0804 EXTRA SPACE STO RIVER EDGE NJ`
- Feb 22: $16.04 — `0804 EXTRA SPACE STO 201-956-0020 NJ`
- Feb 23: $264.76 — `0804 EXTRA SPACE STO RIVER EDGE NJ`

**B. ELLMAX LLC AmEx Business Gold Rewards Card**. Charges appear in [EFTA01684802](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01684802.pdf).

Sample charges from July 2016:
- Jul 12: $215.44 — `EXTRA SPACE STORAGE 0804 5600000111240 RIVER EDGE NJ 201-996-0020`
- Jul 13: $409.11 — same
- Jul 22: $446.08 — same, ref 8042785629684
- Jul 23: $439.66 — same

The recurring pattern of three to four distinct monthly charge amounts — approximately $215, $366, $409, $440 — strongly suggests **at least three separate storage units** at this single facility. The combined monthly expenditure of $1,000-$1,200 indicates substantial storage volume.

116 East 65th Street LLC was the entity that held Ghislaine Maxwell's Manhattan townhouse, one block from Epstein's mansion at 9 East 71st Street. Maxwell was convicted in December 2021 on five counts related to sex trafficking.

**These storage units have not been reported in any media coverage of the Epstein storage unit story.**

## Part 7: The Pattern of Computer Wiping

The corpus documents a systematic practice of wiping computers before disposal:

**January 2015** — Richard Kahn, forwarding photos from the Uncle Bob's storage unit: *"Janusz would like to review with you as he believes some items such as old computers (once wiped) can be discarded"* ([EFTA01747301](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01747301.pdf)).

**October 2013** — Regarding a computer at one of Epstein's properties: *"Scott told me that the old computer from 6 has not been wiped/cleared. He was planning to make sure you were happy with new before doing anything to old"* ([EFTA01951006](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01951006.pdf)).

**September 2013** — IT consultant Scott Denett: *"with the old one I will wipe the data, but leave the programs and settings for you to use @ LSJ as a new computer station"* ([EFTA01755407](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01755407.pdf)).

**January 2017** — Lesley Groff (Epstein's executive assistant) to "James | Personal Genius": *"Jeffrey would like you to get [name]'s computer and wipe it clean"* ([EFTA02202165](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02202165.pdf)). Five days later: *"Jeffrey has asked that James wipe clean [name]'s old computer and then we sent to [person] in Barcelona"* ([EFTA02200825](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02200825.pdf)).

The 2013 and 2017 emails relate to routine computer upgrades — not the three El Brillo Way machines. But the January 2015 email about the Uncle Bob's storage unit explicitly references the computers in that unit as already having been wiped. The question is when, by whom, and whether the wiping destroyed data subject to the court preservation order.

---

## Part 8: What the FBI Never Searched

### The 2019 SDNY Warrants

When the SDNY arrested Epstein on July 6, 2019, they executed search warrants at exactly **two locations** ([EFTA01301568](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01301568.pdf)):

1. **9 East 71st Street, New York** (July 6-11, 2019) — seized CDs, photographs, hard drives, recorders, tablets, USBs, server, cash, and an Austrian passport
2. **Little Saint James Island** (August 12, 2019) — seized servers, surveillance system, phone system, CDs/DVDs, hard drives, desktops, laptops, logbooks

**No search warrant was executed on:**
- Manhattan Mini Storage (the Riley computers)
- Uncle Bob's / The Store Room, West Palm Beach
- Public Storage, Delray Beach or West Palm Beach
- Extra Space Storage, Royal Palm Beach
- Extra Space Storage #0804, River Edge, NJ (Maxwell)
- UOVO, Long Island City (Maxwell)
- Any other storage facility

The FBI was aware of the storage units. The 2007 declaration about Kleiman's cloning was transmitted to an FBI Special Agent on the day it happened. The Riley email about computers "locked in storage" was produced in discovery. The AmEx credit card statements documenting monthly payments to multiple storage companies were in the EFTA production. None of this led to a search warrant.

### The Safe That Almost Disappeared

Between the July 7 and July 11 search warrants, house manager **Merwin Delacruz** packed Epstein's belongings from his safe into two suitcases and transported them to **Richard Kahn's nearby residence** ([EFTA01301594](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01301594.pdf)). The suitcases contained two binders of CDs, multiple passports (including an Austrian passport), jewelry, a Customs mini-badge, and a wallet. Agents recovered the suitcases after contacting Kahn.

Kahn — the same person who in January 2015 suggested the storage unit computers could be "discarded once wiped" — was the destination for safe contents being removed from a property under active federal search warrant.

## Part 9: Florida Lien Law and the Clock

Under **Florida Statutes §§ 83.801-83.809** (Self-Storage Facility Act):

- After **5 days** of unpaid rent, a storage facility may deny the renter access
- After written notice with a **14-day demand period**, the facility may advertise the unit for sale
- The sale must be advertised **once per week for 2 consecutive weeks**
- From default to auction: approximately **45-60 days**
- Surplus proceeds unclaimed for **2 years** are deemed abandoned

Jeffrey Epstein died on August 10, 2019. If no one continued paying rent on the Florida storage units, the facilities could have auctioned their contents as early as **October 2019**. The estate executors, Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn, may have continued payments — but the sealed USVI probate proceedings have never disclosed the disposition of storage unit contents. A USVI judge has denied public access to probate reports three times, most recently in February 2026.

Law enforcement access to storage unit contents requires a **search warrant** under Florida Chapter 933. A subpoena can compel the storage company to produce records — including current lease status, renter name, payment history, and whether a lien sale has occurred — but accessing the physical contents requires a warrant.

The identifying details in this report — store numbers, merchant references, phone numbers, addresses — are sufficient to subpoena every storage company for current records.

## Part 10: The Chain of Custody That Never Was

The timeline of the three El Brillo Way computers:

|------|-------|--------|
| **Oct 7, 2005** | Paul Lavery removes 3 computers + 100+ items from 358 El Brillo Way at Roy Black's direction | [EFTA01733753](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01733753.pdf) |
| **Oct 9, 2005** | Riley completes inventory, items in his custody | [EFTA01733753](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01733753.pdf) |
| **Oct 20, 2005** | PBPD executes search warrant; finds monitors but no computers, no media | [EFTA01334241](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01334241.pdf) |

| **Sep 24, 2007** | NPA signed; requires Epstein to withdraw motion to quash computer subpoena | [EFTA01659971](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01659971.pdf) |
| **Jan 29, 2008** | AUSA Villafana notes Epstein "never did" withdraw the motion | [EFTA01659971](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01659971.pdf) |

| **Nov 2009+** | Riley invoices for "New York Storage facility" at $490/month | [EFTA00612018](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00612018.pdf) |
| **Sep 2010** | Riley asks Epstein to take over Manhattan Mini Storage billing | [EFTA00757442](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00757442.pdf) |
| **Jan 2015** | "3 computers" in Uncle Bob's storage, WPB; Kahn: "once wiped, can be discarded" | [EFTA01747301](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01747301.pdf) |
| **Jul 6, 2019** | SDNY arrests Epstein, searches mansion — does not search any storage unit | [EFTA01301568](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01301568.pdf) |
| **Aug 10, 2019** | Epstein dies. Florida lien clock starts if payments stop. | — |
| **?** | Current status of all units unknown | — |

The three computers were removed from the mansion, cloned by a forensics expert who died in 2013, subpoenaed by a grand jury that never received them, held in a Manhattan storage unit paid for by the target of the investigation, transferred to a Palm Beach storage unit where they were wiped, and at no point seized by law enforcement.

The 12 forensic copies — the bit-for-bit images that would have preserved whatever was on those drives in 2005 — have never been located. Riley's 2009 email states Roy Black *"would have the results of that effort."* Roy Black died in 2025.
