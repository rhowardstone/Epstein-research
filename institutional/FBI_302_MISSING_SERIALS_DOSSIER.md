# Missing FBI 302s: A Gap Analysis of the EFTA Production

**WORKING DOCUMENT — NOT FOR PUBLICATION**
**Prepared for editorial review**

---

## Executive Summary

The DOJ's Epstein Files Transparency Act production contains internal FBI indices that list more interview records than were actually published. By cross-referencing three key documents — the FBI's own serial log, the prosecution's disclosure index, and the interview master list — we can identify specific FD-302 interview reports that the government's records say exist but that do not appear in the published files.

This is not about documents that were uploaded and taken down. These appear to be records that were **never collated into the production** — despite being listed in the FBI's own internal indices within the same production.

## The Three Key Index Documents

### 1. Interview Master List — EFTA00016612

**[EFTA00016612](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016612.pdf)** (Dataset 8, 4 pages)

A document titled **"Interviews 136"** listing 136 FBI interview serial numbers in the `3501.XXX` format. These are FBI case file serials from the Epstein/Maxwell investigation. The serials run from 3501.002 through 3501.516, with a separate section labeled "Interview/Contact with third party" listing three additional entries (3501.24, 3501.44, 3501.45).

**Full serial list** (136 entries):

| 2 | 3501.208, .210, .213, .215, .219, .221, .222, .223, .226, .238, .330, .340, .377, .384, .401, .409, .472, .474, .477, .478, .478 (duplicate), .479, .480, .481, .482, .483, .484, .485, .486, .492, .496, .497, .499, .500, .503, .504, .511, .512, .513, .514, .515, .516 |
| 3 | 3501.205, .206 + "Interview/Contact with third party": 3501.24, .44, .45 |

### 2. Prosecution Disclosure Index — EFTA00095751

**[EFTA00095751](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00095751.pdf)** (Dataset 9, 63 pages)

The prosecution's master disclosure index for *United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell* (20 Cr. 330), dated November 6, 2021. This document lists **423 unique FBI serials** (3501.000 through 3501.546) with their individual sub-records — every photograph, interview note, FD-302, audio recording, and supporting document that was produced to the Maxwell defense team.

Each entry includes:
- Serial and sub-serial number (e.g., 3501.045-001)
- Date of the underlying record
- Description (e.g., "Interview 302," "Interview Notes," "Photograph")
- Date produced to defense

This is the **Rosetta Stone** — it tells us exactly what should exist for each serial.

### 3. FBI Master Serial Log — EFTA01684300

**[EFTA01684300](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01684300.pdf)** (Dataset 10, 166 pages)

The master FBI serial log for case **SOD-NY-3027571** — the 2019 SDNY investigation. Lists approximately 701 serials using a different numbering system (integer serials 1–701 rather than the 3501.XXX format). Heavily redacted. Contains FD-302 entries, search warrants, pen registers, arrest records, CHS (confidential human source) intelligence reports, and NTOC tips.

**Important**: This log uses a *different serial numbering system* from EFTA00016612. The 3501.XXX system appears to be the FBI's case file management numbering, while EFTA01684300 uses a sequential serial numbering within the SDNY case.

## Case Study: Serial 3501.045 — The Missing 302s

Serial 3501.045 is identified in the interview index as one of the 136 interview serials. The user identified this serial as relating to **Victim 1 in the Trump accusation slides** — a reference to the well-known photograph of Epstein and Donald Trump that was used in FBI victim identification.

### What the Disclosure Index Says Should Exist

According to EFTA00095751 (page 7), serial 3501.045 has **15 sub-records**:

| Sub-Serial | Date | Description | Produced to Defense |
|------------|------|-------------|---------------------|

**8 of 15 sub-records are missing**, including **3 of the 4 FD-302 interview reports** and all 3 sets of interview notes.

The only published 302 for this victim (Interview One, EFTA01245620) contains the notable passage on page 6:

> *"[Administrative Note: [The victim] agreed to allow the Agents to take a photograph of the cropped image (attached electronically as a 1A attachment). Of note, the particular image sent to her by [friend] was recognized by Agents as a widely distributed photograph of JEFFREY EPSTEIN and current United States President DONALD TRUMP. The cropped image [the victim] provided to the Agents only included JEFFREY EPSTEIN.]"*

The victim identified Epstein from this photograph as "JEFF," the man who sexually abused her beginning at approximately age 13 at Sea Pines Plantation, South Carolina.

**Three additional FBI interviews of this same victim — dated June 7, August 20, and October 16, 2019 — are listed in the government's own index but do not appear in the published files.**

### The 136 vs. 419 Discrepancy

The interview index (EFTA00016612) lists **136** interview serials. The corpus contains **419** standalone FD-302 documents. These numbers are not directly comparable because:

1. Each serial can have multiple sub-records (e.g., 3501.045 has 4 FD-302s)
2. The 419 count includes 302s from multiple investigations (MCC death, Palm Beach, SDNY)
3. The 136-serial list appears to cover only the SDNY sex trafficking prosecution interviews

The prosecution disclosure index (EFTA00095751) lists **423 unique serials** with potentially thousands of sub-records. The full gap analysis requires parsing all 63 pages of that index against the corpus.

### The "Expected vs. Found" Problem

The prosecution disclosure index (EFTA00095751) *should* tell us exactly how many sub-records exist per serial. However, the OCR quality of this 63-page scanned document is extremely poor — Tesseract produced garbled text where serial numbers and sub-serial numbers are frequently misread.

**Example**: For 3501.045, we manually verified 15 sub-records on page 7 of the disclosure index. The automated parser found only 3 sub-serials due to OCR errors. This means the programmatic "expected" counts are **severe undercounts** and cannot be relied upon for gap calculation.

**What we CAN say**: The corpus search found **6 actual documents** for 3501.045, and our manual verification confirmed that **7 of 15 sub-records** exist as EFTA documents (the 7th — EFTA01245632, the crisis intake — didn't have "3501.045" in its OCR text, so the script missed it). That means **8 of 15 are missing**.

A reliable full gap analysis would require either:
1. Better OCR of EFTA00095751 (the original PDF is available at justice.gov)
2. Manual review of all 63 pages
3. A dedicated OCR pass with a more capable engine than Tesseract

---

## Methodology

### Data Sources
- **Full text corpus database** (`full_text_corpus.db`): 1,385,879 documents, 2,770,154 pages — FTS5 indexed
- All three index documents read in full from the database, page by page

### Search Approach
- FD-302 identification: Documents with "FD-302" AND "FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION" on page 0
- Serial matching: LIKE queries for `3501.XXX` patterns across all pages
- Sub-record verification: Cross-referencing disclosure index entries against EFTA documents stamped with matching serial numbers

### Limitations
- The OCR quality of EFTA00095751 (prosecution disclosure index) is poor — it is a Tesseract extraction of a scanned PDF. Some serial numbers and names may be misread.
- EFTA01684300 (master serial log) is heavily redacted — most dates appear as `########` and many names are truncated.
- The `3501.XXX` serial numbering system and the integer serial system in EFTA01684300 have not been fully mapped to each other.
- A complete gap analysis of all 423 serials and their sub-records against the EFTA production has not yet been performed. The 3501.045 case study demonstrates the approach.

## What This Means

### The Proven Gap (3501.045)

For the one serial we audited manually, **more than half the records are missing**. The FBI's own disclosure index says 15 sub-records were produced to the Maxwell defense team. Only 7 appear in the EFTA production. The 3 missing FD-302 interview reports represent 3 separate FBI interviews with this victim — on June 7, August 20, and October 16, 2019 — that were conducted, documented, produced to the defense, and then not included in the public release.

### The Scale of the Problem

If the 3501.045 gap rate (~53% missing) is representative, then across 136 interview serials with potentially thousands of sub-records, hundreds of FBI documents may be absent from the published files. The disclosure index alone runs 63 pages.

### Three Categories of Missing Records

1. **FD-302 Interview Reports**: The core product of FBI interviews — the detailed written summaries of what witnesses and victims told the FBI. These are the most consequential missing documents.

2. **Interview Notes**: The raw handwritten or typed notes agents took during interviews. These sometimes contain details not in the formal 302.

3. **Supporting Records**: Law enforcement reports, licenses, photographs, audio recordings, and other materials attached to each interview serial.

### Possible Explanations

- **Redaction scope**: Some records may have been withheld entirely (rather than redacted) due to victim privacy, ongoing investigations, or national security
- **Production error**: Records that were disclosed to Maxwell's defense but not properly ingested into the EFTA production pipeline
- **Classified material**: The master serial log contains S//NF (Sources/Methods — Not Releasable to Foreign Nationals) entries that would not be publishable
- **Sealed records**: Some materials may remain under seal by court order

The disclosure index explicitly notes it is "SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, and 17" — which governs handling of sensitive materials in the Maxwell case.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Better OCR of EFTA00095751**: The justice.gov PDF is available. A dedicated OCR pass (or manual transcription of the 63 pages) would allow a complete accounting of every expected sub-record
2. **Deep-dive additional serials**: Replicate the 3501.045 manual audit for the largest serials (3501.226, 3501.103, 3501.162, 3501.055) to establish the gap rate across multiple interview files
3. **Cross-reference CHS intelligence reports**: The master serial log references confidential human source reports on topics including Israeli foreign influence, Chabad, Masha Drokova, and classified Epstein material — are any of these in the published files?
4. **FOIA request**: The disclosure index provides specific serial numbers and dates that can be cited in a targeted FOIA request for the missing 302s
5. **Congressional inquiry**: The interview index (EFTA00016612) and disclosure index (EFTA00095751) together constitute a roadmap for oversight — the government's own records documenting what should exist
