# Italian Connections: Political Access, Industrial Dynasties, and the Mediterranean Social Circuit

## Three Threads Through ~450 Documents, 2001–2019

*Based on forensic analysis of the DOJ EFTA production (Datasets 8–11) and House Oversight materials*

---

## Executive Summary

The Epstein files contain a substantial Italian network story that unfolds across three domains: **political access** (Berlusconi via Ian Osborne, Bannon's 2018 Italy tour), **industrial dynasty cultivation** (the Agnelli family through Eduardo Teodorani-Fabbri, EXOR, Elkann), and the **Mediterranean social circuit** (Flavio Briatore, Sardinia, the jet-set rotation between Rome, Sardinia, and Paris).

No Italian politicians appear in direct personal communication with Epstein. The political access was always mediated — through British consultant Ian Osborne for the Berlusconi circle, and through Steve Bannon for the broader European populist movement. What the documents reveal is not a direct Italian political network but an **infrastructure of access**: intermediaries, cultivation strategies, and a pattern of positioning Epstein at the intersection of Italian political power and industrial wealth.

The strongest thread is **Eduardo Teodorani-Fabbri**, a CNH Industrial Senior Vice President and nephew of Gianni Agnelli, who maintained an eight-year documented relationship with Epstein (2011–2019, with records back to 2002), calling him "Master" throughout. The most significant political document is a **July–August 2011 exchange** in which Berlusconi's intermediary acknowledged that "Mr. B isn't without his own issues in that department" — a mutual recognition of sex scandal as a non-barrier to meeting.

## Part 1: Political Access — The Berlusconi Connection (Summer 2011)

### The Players

- **Jeffrey Epstein** (jeevacation@gmail.com)
- **Ian Osborne** — British political consultant who had previously advised Madonna during her divorce from Guy Ritchie; maintained a "contact at No. 10" (Downing Street); introduced to Epstein possibly through Guy Ritchie
- **"Valentini"** — intermediary with direct access to Berlusconi's inner circle, tracking Berlusconi's movements between Rome and Sardinia
- **"Mr. B" / Silvio Berlusconi** — then-Prime Minister of Italy, at that moment on trial for paying for sex with an underage dancer (the ["Bunga Bunga" trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trials_of_Silvio_Berlusconi#Ruby_trial), which began April 6, 2011)

### Timeline

**July 27, 2011 — Epstein proposes the meeting:**

> *"i can see valentini in rome on the 6th or 7th.."*

— Epstein to Osborne, [EFTA01861377](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01861377.pdf)

The "6th or 7th" was a Saturday/Sunday — August 6–7, 2011.

**July 29, 2011 — Osborne confirms and discusses business structuring:**

> *"Absolutely — I would welcome the advice, and I can't think of anyone who knows these things better than you.... either by phone anytime or, if we see Valentini on the 6th or 7th, in Rome. Your instincts sound absolutely correct — I can see how the law firm plays an important part of the overall structure, but interested to know how best to optimise. I will come back to you on Valentini by Monday."*

— Osborne to Epstein, [EFTA01787899](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01787899.pdf)

The underlying Epstein email advised Osborne on structuring a business entity: *"you should think about setting it up so as to make it easy to be bought in three years. so that it needs to be compartmentalized."*

**August 2, 2011 — Osborne speaks to Valentini:**

> *"Spoke to Valentini. As of now he is more likely to be in Sardinia than Rome on Sunday — with Berlusconi these things are fluid, especially with the EU bailout talks at the moment. He will keep me posted. I can meet you in Rome, or alternatively in Paris early next week."*

— Osborne to Epstein, [EFTA02031956](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02031956.pdf)

The EU bailout talks — Italy's [2011 sovereign debt crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011%E2%80%9312_Italian_financial_crisis) — were making Berlusconi's schedule unpredictable. Berlusconi's [Villa Certosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Certosa) estate was in Sardinia, where he frequently retreated.

**August 2, 2011 — Epstein raises Prince Andrew concerns:**

> *"Great, FYI always remember I prefer brutal honesty ie if they are concerned re prince Andrew. Sorry for all the typos. Sent from my iPhone"*

— Epstein to Osborne, [EFTA01859935](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01859935.pdf)

By August 2011, Prince Andrew had stepped down as UK trade envoy (July 2011) amid sustained tabloid coverage of his friendship with Epstein. Epstein was proactively asking: will my baggage torpedo this meeting?

**August 2, 2011 — "Mr. B isn't without his own issues":**

> *"Understood. But in this case, they are aware and as Valentini pointed out, Mr. B isn't without his own issues in that department. So it is not just him being polite."*

— Osborne to Epstein, [EFTA02012044](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02012044.pdf) (also [EFTA01800085](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01800085.pdf), [EFTA00916493](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00916493.pdf))

This is the key document. Valentini told Osborne that Berlusconi would not be deterred by Epstein's Prince Andrew association because Berlusconi had his own "issues in that department" — the Bunga Bunga trial, in which Berlusconi was accused of paying for sex with then-17-year-old [Karima El Mahroug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karima_El_Mahroug). "It is not just him being polite" — the openness to meeting Epstein was genuine, not diplomatic courtesy despite private reservations.

**August 3, 2011 — Epstein confirms Rome schedule:**

> *"new schedule.. i will leave rome on mon afternoon, to dubai, (rulers) then abu dhabi (rulers) then saudi, then senegal. then paris on sat. 13"*

— Epstein to Osborne, [EFTA00915994](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00915994.pdf)

### Corroboration: Epstein Was in Rome August 5–8, 2011

Multiple independent email chains confirm Epstein's Rome presence that weekend:

- **Flight booking** (July 18): Paris to Rome on August 5, Rome to Trieste on August 7, Trieste to Paris — Hawker 400XP at $23,485 ([EFTA02000542](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02000542.pdf))
- **Woody Allen dinner** (August 1): Epstein's assistant Sarah K. emailed Woody Allen's assistant Melissa to confirm: *"Jeffrey wanted me to touch base with you about the plans with Woody this weekend. We will be arriving into Rome on Friday the 5th, and staying at the Parco dei Principi Grand Hotel."* Allen and Soon-Yi would take Epstein to dinner Saturday at 8pm. ([EFTA02000453](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02000453.pdf))
- **Maxwell in Rome** (August 5): Maxwell to Epstein: *"Don't arrive till 4.30..."* in response to Epstein's *"we will be having lunch at mastios in rome on sunday"* ([EFTA01990686](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01990686.pdf))
- **"Rome with woody"** (August 8): Epstein confirmed: *"rome with woody"* ([EFTA01990982](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01990982.pdf))
- **Boris Nikolic from Capri** (August 5): *"Just arrived to Capri few hours ago... You should come here for a day! It is a short helicopter ride from rome"* ([EFTA01990036](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01990036.pdf))

**August 20, 2011 — "Team Berlusconi" still active:**

> *"Yes definitely, but other than Team Berlusconi, I need some more direction from you as to which of the people I can suggest are most relevant at this time."*

— Osborne to Epstein, [EFTA01987391](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01987391.pdf)

Two weeks after the planned meeting, Osborne treats "Team Berlusconi" as an established project and asks for direction on other contacts. In the same exchange:

> *"be sensitive re your contact at No. 10/// talks a bit much"*

— Epstein to Osborne, [EFTA01857180](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01857180.pdf)

"No. 10" = 10 Downing Street. The Prime Minister was David Cameron. Epstein is warning Osborne that someone connected to the Cameron government is indiscreet.

### Did the Meeting Happen?

The evidence shows:
1. Epstein proposed meeting Valentini on August 6–7 in Rome
2. Valentini reported Berlusconi might be in Sardinia rather than Rome
3. Epstein was confirmed in Rome from August 5 through at least August 8
4. Both sides acknowledged each other's sex scandals as non-barriers
5. "Team Berlusconi" was still active as a project on August 20

The evidence does **not** show: any email explicitly confirming or denying that a face-to-face meeting with Berlusconi or Valentini took place that weekend. The continued "Team Berlusconi" reference suggests the relationship was being cultivated, but the outcome is undocumented.

### Identifying "Valentini"

The corpus contains multiple "Valentini" references — the physicist **Antony Valentini** (Clemson University, who wrote to Epstein in January 2014 requesting quantum mechanics funding — [EFTA00981180](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00981180.pdf)) and **Giovanni Valentini S.R.L.** (an Italian company in bank wire records — [EFTA01731317](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01731317.pdf)). Neither is the "Valentini" in the Berlusconi thread.

The political Valentini — described as tracking Berlusconi's movements between Rome and Sardinia, serving as intermediary to "Mr. B," and knowledgeable about Berlusconi's legal troubles — is consistent with **[Valentino Valentini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentino_Valentini_(politician))** (born 1962, Bologna), Berlusconi's longtime Special Adviser on Foreign Relations. In 2011, Valentini was a Member of Parliament and Head of the Office of the Prime Minister / Foreign Relations Special Adviser during Berlusconi's third government. A U.S. diplomatic cable characterized him as Berlusconi's ["unofficial intermediary/bagman."](https://valentinovalentini.it/en/biografia-valentino-valentini/) He went on to serve as a Member of the European Parliament (2014–2019) and was appointed [Deputy Minister at the Ministry of Enterprise and Made in Italy](https://www.governo.it/en/governo/meloni/undersecretary-state/valentino-valentini) under the Meloni government in October 2022. This identification is circumstantial — no full name appears in the corpus — but the profile (Rome-based, direct Berlusconi access, political operative, tracking the PM's movements) fits no other known figure.

## Part 2: Political Access — Bannon's Italian Tour (2018–2019)

The Bannon–Epstein iMessage thread ([EFTA01614963](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01614963.pdf) through EFTA01616110, Dataset 10) is an extensive conversation spanning March 2018 through May 2019. Italy is a recurring and central theme — not as Bannon's incidental destination but as the **primary theater** of the European populist movement that Epstein was advising.

For the broader Bannon–Epstein relationship, see the [Shaher Abdulhak / "Mr. Evil" investigation](../individuals/SHAHER_ABDULHAK_MR_EVIL_INVESTIGATION.md). This section focuses specifically on the Italian dimension.

### March 8, 2018 — Bannon's Italian Itinerary

Four days after the March 4, 2018 Italian general election — in which the Five Star Movement and Salvini's League shattered the political establishment — Bannon messaged Epstein:

> *"Yes... I'm heading into Milan right now for meeting with salvini --- looks like tonight Grillo and tomorrow Rome and berlusconi and 5 star--- front nationale wants me to address their conference on Saturday --- thoughts"*

Epstein responded within 15 minutes:

> *"Not my expertise! I think attend but not address, too many echoes of Charlottesville."*
>
> *"As the whitehouse looks more like Home Alone 3 - your brand is on the rise and I would think about the upside vs risk of dimming it"*
>
> *"Less is more"*

Bannon: *"Agree"*

— [EFTA01614963](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01614963.pdf), page 2

Bannon was meeting Matteo Salvini in Milan, Beppe Grillo (founder of Five Star Movement) that evening, then traveling to Rome for Berlusconi and Five Star, with a Front National conference invitation for Saturday. Epstein advised against addressing the Front National conference — citing "echoes of Charlottesville" (the August 2017 far-right rally) — and Bannon accepted the advice.

That evening, Bannon reported: *"with salvini team; trying to figure out"*. Epstein offered his Paris residence and a dinner the following night: *"Tomorrow night sultan from Dubai, head of council of Europe plus Nobel peace prize chairman. You are welcome. And you are welcome to stay."* Bannon: *"best time ever."* ([EFTA01614963](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01614963.pdf), page 3)

### May 2018 — Epstein Brokers Italian Introductions

During the May 2018 Italian government formation crisis, Epstein offered Bannon access to his Italian industrial network:

> *"If you would like to meet some of the Italian industrialists. Fiat INI etc in Rome, let me know"*

— Epstein to Bannon, May 27, 2018, [EFTA01615108](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01615108.pdf)

Bannon was in Rome giving a live speech on the government collapse: *"Btw giving 3 pm speech live in Rome on collapse govt."* Epstein advised: *"Though not great for the country. new elections in Italy will give you a pretty good rehearsal for European parliament campaigns for next may."*

On the same day, Epstein messaged Eduardo Teodorani-Fabbri (see Part 3):

> *"Steve Bannon will be in Rome. Do you want to meet"*
>
> Teodorani: *"Ok"*

— [EFTA01617521](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01617521.pdf)

And to Nicole Junkermann:

> *"bannon and the new govt guys in italy woud like me to come visit. rome. in mid late june. will you be there?"*

— [EFTA02655637](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02655637.pdf)

Epstein was actively brokering connections between Bannon and his Italian network — Teodorani (Agnelli family/CNH Industrial), Junkermann (connected in China and Italy), and unnamed "Italian industrialists."

### July 2018 — Epstein as Strategic Advisor to "The Movement"

Benjamin Harnwell (founder of the Dignitatis Humanae Institute, based at 44 Via delle Fornaci, Rome) forwarded an Italian newspaper article about Bannon's "[Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Movement_(political_group))" to Bannon, who forwarded it to Epstein. Epstein's response was a detailed strategic memo:

> *"If you are going to play here, you'll have to spend time, europe by remote doesn't work. Lots and lots of face time and hand holding"*
>
> *"its doable, but time consuming, there are many leaders of countries we can organize for you to have one on ones. however. you will have to come, stay 8-10 days, then no more than two weeks later. the same. The fear is that you gin up their hopes and emotions and then abandon them. I think you want to be an insider, not an outsider flying in and out."*

— [EFTA02601536](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02601536.pdf)

Epstein claimed he could "organize" one-on-one meetings with "leaders of countries" for Bannon — not merely offering opinions, but positioning himself as a political infrastructure provider.

### August–October 2018 — Real-Time Intelligence

Epstein provided Bannon with macroeconomic intelligence relevant to his Italian project:

> *"Turkey lira could have an impact on Italy. banks.."*

— August 12, 2018, [EFTA01615242](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01615242.pdf)

When Bannon was in Rome in September 2018, Epstein delivered serious legal advice on FARA (Foreign Agents Registration Act) compliance:

> *"No rush, I just want you to be surgically pure re registrations disclosures etc. As you move into more institutional International arrangements.. the tension between 501 c4 opaque, and fara transparency needs bright light focus. No stepping on your dick allowed."*
>
> *"Some of fara - 'quasi political' affiliations. Kick in after 10 days of formation"*

— [EFTA01615316](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01615316.pdf)

By October 2018, Epstein cautioned Bannon about overextension: *"on your flight home. Take time to assess YOUR position on the board. You need to rest! bolsonaro, le pen, salvini, Wilbur, I don't like the momentum. - recall I think Icarus was jet lagged."* ([EFTA01615409](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01615409.pdf))

### December 2018 — The Junkermann Introduction

> *"If you have a moment you should meet my friend Nicole.. she is great."*
>
> *"Nicole junkman, countess. At the moment. 40 years old.. husband chair of INI Italy, she is an old friend.. well connected china Italy."*
>
> Bannon: *"Next time I'm there certainly -- love converting aristos to our righteous cause"*

— [EFTA01615501](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01615501.pdf)

Epstein introduced Junkermann to Bannon as "well connected china Italy." For the full Junkermann investigation, see [the dedicated report](../individuals/JUNKERMANN_MC2_INVESTIGATION.md).

### 2019 — Election Night and Continued Rome Operations

Bannon continued operating from Rome:

> *"Just got to Rome -- do big speech tomorrow"* (March 20, 2019, [EFTA01615663](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01615663.pdf))
>
> *"Is it possible to get your plane here to collect me"* ... *"Rome"* ... *"Anytime tomorrow after 1 pm -- I'm in meetings with The League here until then"* (March 29, 2019, [EFTA01615683](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01615683.pdf))

On European Parliament election night in May 2019, Epstein and Bannon exchanged real-time commentary:

> Bannon: *"Salvini @ 28 to 31--leaked too early"* ... *"Salvini should have been 34/35"* ... *"LePen now controls situation"*
>
> Epstein: *"Macron down? Boris up. Merkel down. You up GREAT"*

— [EFTA01616110](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01616110.pdf)

### What's Documented vs. What's Not

The iMessages show Epstein functioning as a **real-time political advisor** to Bannon on European populism, with Italy as the primary theater. Epstein offered strategic advice (don't address the Front National conference), macroeconomic intelligence (Turkey lira → Italian banks), legal counsel (FARA compliance), logistical support (his plane, his Paris residence), and network access (Italian industrialists, Teodorani, Junkermann).

What the documents do **not** show: any evidence that Epstein himself met or communicated with Italian politicians. Bannon met Salvini, Grillo, and Berlusconi; Epstein advised Bannon remotely. The "leaders of countries" meetings Epstein offered to organize are referenced but not documented as having occurred.

## Part 3: Industrial Dynasties — The Agnelli Orbit

### Eduardo Teodorani-Fabbri: "Master"

Eduardo Teodorani-Fabbri (born September 21, 1965, Rome) held the title **Senior Vice President, Corporate Development** at **[CNH Industrial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNH_Industrial)** N.V. (the Agnelli family's agricultural and construction equipment conglomerate), based at Cranes Farm Road, Basildon, Essex. His corporate email was eduardo.teodorani@cnhindustrial.com.

His mother was **[Maria Sole Agnelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Sole_Agnelli)** (1925–2025), Gianni Agnelli's sister. His father was Count Pio Teodorani-Fabbri. This makes Eduardo **Gianni Agnelli's nephew** (sister's son) and a second cousin of John, Lapo, and Ginevra Elkann. Italian press describes him as ["il cugino degli Elkann"](https://www.fanpage.it/esteri/dagli-epstein-files-spunta-il-cugino-degli-elkann-chi-e-eduardo-teodorani-fabbri-e-cosa-faceva/) — the Elkanns' cousin.

Teodorani-Fabbri's family connection is also confirmed in a November 2018 iMessage between Epstein and Bannon:

> **Epstein**: *"Eduardos uncle. Was Gianni Agnelli. The original Italian playboy."*
>
> **Bannon**: *"Yes I just read up on him"*
>
> **Bannon**: *"Now I see where you get it from"*
>
> **Epstein**: *"You should ask Eduardo what title he uses to refer to me. You'll crack up"*

— [EFTA01618012](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01618012.pdf)

That "title" is documented throughout the corpus: Teodorani consistently called Epstein **"Master"** — in emails, SMS, iMessages, and WhatsApp messages across the entire 2011–2019 period.

### The Relationship: 17 Years of Documentation (2002–2019)

The earliest record is a **FedEx shipment** from Epstein's office (Cecilia Steen, 457 Madison Avenue) to "EDUARDO TEODORANI-FABBRI, CNH UK LIMITED" in October 2002 (DOJ-OGR-00015310).

The earliest financial record is an **April 2003 wire transfer** of $10,000 from "NEW YORK STRATEGY GROUP, LLC" (an Epstein entity) to "MR. E TEODORANI-FABBRI" via National Westminster Bank PLC, London, referencing CNH Global's Basildon address ([EFTA01513978](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01513978.pdf)).

The email corpus documents sustained contact from 2011 through March 2019 — four months before Epstein's arrest.

### Key Episodes

**September 2011 — Introducing Teodorani to Jes Staley:**

> *"eduardo tedodorni, family head, and member of agnelli family, owner of ferrari maserate and fiat will be with me next sat, save time"*

— Epstein to Jes Staley (then JPMorgan), [EFTA01301166](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01301166.pdf)

This document appears in the SDNY/JPMorgan Chase discovery production.

**March 2013 — Bill Gates in Paris:**

> **Epstein**: *"will have bill gates staying with me in paris, what day can you come"*
>
> **Teodorani** (via assistant Karen, in Italian): *"Avvissa epstein the saro li martedi e mercoledi"* [Tell Epstein I'll be there Tuesday and Wednesday]

— [EFTA01898746](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01898746.pdf)

**June 2013 — Vera Wang internship for Agnelli family member:**

> *"see if vera wang would like an intern from the agnelli family"*

— Epstein to assistant Lesley Groff, [EFTA01969443](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01969443.pdf)

Vera Wang's office requested the resume. The intern was named **Margherita** ([EFTA02136534](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02136534.pdf)).

**June 2013 — Cushman & Wakefield intelligence:**

> *"who from the family, is on the cushman and wakefiled operation, they have asked my friend to get involved."*

— Epstein to Teodorani, [EFTA01969734](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01969734.pdf)

[EXOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exor_(company)), the Agnelli family holding company, owned Cushman & Wakefield from 2007 to 2015.

**October 2013 — Sending a woman to London:**

> **Epstein**: *"a very very beutiful friend coming to london for tues. are you there?"*
>
> **Teodorani**: *"Yes tell her to give me a call"*

— [EFTA01950438](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01950438.pdf)

Days later, Teodorani emailed with the subject line: **"Master she is beautiful and very nice. Xxxx Eduardo"** ([EFTA02576364](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02576364.pdf))

**December 2013 — Christmas on Epstein's island:**

> **Epstein** (to Teodorani and Davina DeForest Cornish): *"are you guys going to come to carib for xmas. woody alien will be on the island with a bunch of intersting people you both are welcome of course"*
>
> **Davina**: *"That sounds fantastic. I would love to come just after Christmas if you are there through New Years?"*

— [EFTA01945651](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01945651.pdf)

**August 2015 — The U-First venture pitch:**

Teodorani forwarded a business pitch from **Paolo Barletta** via his CNH Industrial email — a venture called **"U-First"** with memo "Ufirstinfo_Memo_Aug_2015_-_Eduardo_Teodorani.pdf" ([EFTA00343270](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00343270.pdf)). Teodorani pushed Epstein to invest: *"So would you like to put some money in it"*. Epstein declined: *"yes. not the type of thing i invest in but always send me alternatives."* ([EFTA01743952](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01743952.pdf))

**February 2018 — Ferrari factory tour for Dan Ariely:**

> **Epstein**: *"Edo, a very well known author and friend would loves tour of the Ferrari factory late March. Name Dan Ariely"*
>
> **Teodorani**: *"Off course master. Have you pa contact mine and I will made Him drive our latest model on our private truck of fiorano and have a private visit of the plant."*

— [EFTA02517743](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02517743.pdf)

The visit to [Fiorano Circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fioranello) (Ferrari's private test track) was confirmed and arranged through assistants ([EFTA00870220](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00870220.pdf)).

**May 2018 — Bannon introduction:**

> **Teodorani**: *"Call me when you can worried about ITALY"*
>
> **Epstein**: *"Steve Bannon will be in Rome. Do you want to meet"*
>
> **Teodorani**: *"Ok"*

— [EFTA01617521](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01617521.pdf)

Teodorani then recommended his friend as a Rome fixer: *"My friend Paolo Barletta is the rapresent of the new young powerful generation you can google him I can't be in Rome. He know all this new everyone."*

**March 2019 — The final documented exchanges:**

Teodorani arranged Epstein's Rome trip: *"Paolo is waiting for you in Rome a lot of fun."* He sent contact cards for **Dott. Ugo Brachetti Peretti** (Italian industrial aristocrat), **Dott. Fabio Borghese** (Roman nobility), and **Paolo Barletta** (CEO of GB Holding SRL / [Barletta Costruzioni](https://www.costruzionibarletta.com/)). He also sent a Google image search for **Ilaria Spada** (Italian actress) and offered Epstein his private security detail: *"If you need security let me know that I will provide it with ours."* ([EFTA01617531](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01617531.pdf))

**February 28, 2019 — The last meeting:**

Epstein's schedule shows: *"3:30pm w/Eduardo Teodorani and his friend, Paolo Barletta of Barletta Costruzioni"* in New York ([EFTA00285740](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00285740.pdf), page 4).

This was approximately four months before Epstein's arrest on July 6, 2019.

### Paolo Barletta / Barletta Costruzioni

Paolo Barletta is a Roman real estate developer and CEO of **[Gruppo Barletta](http://www.barlettagroup.com/en/about-en/)**, a leading Italian real estate development company founded in Rome in 1953. The group has developed over one million square meters across Italy. Barletta reorganized the family business in 2010, grew it 25% per year, and expanded from 48 to 250 employees. He also established Alchimia SpA (investment company, 2018) and serves as CEO of Arsenale Group (luxury hospitality). His vCard in the corpus identifies him as CEO of GB Holding SRL with website www.costruzionibarletta.com. He co-authored the U-First venture pitch sent to Epstein in August 2015, and by 2018–2019 served as Teodorani's proxy when Teodorani could not be in Rome: *"My friend Paolo Barletta is the rapresent of the new young powerful generation... He know all this new everyone."*

### The Elkann Family: "The New Target"

The Agnelli connection extended beyond Teodorani to the family's most powerful member — **John Elkann**, chairman of [EXOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exor_(company)) and [Stellantis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellantis) (successor to Fiat Chrysler).

**October 2011 — Mapping the Agnelli Asia platform:**

David Stern (Epstein's European deal intermediary, see below) reported from Hong Kong:

> *"In Hong Kong I will be meeting the guy who is apparently building the Asia platform for the Agnelli family, mainly for John Elkann (EXOR) not the guy we met in London. Mr. Tobias Brown, Managing Director of UCL Asia. Mr. Tobias Brown began his career in Hong Kong managing the investments of the late Sir James Goldsmith and, after his death, the assets of his family(ies). He remains closely associated with the Goldsmith interests and has spent the last year working closely with John Elkann to help develop a global investment platform for the Agnelli family of Italy."*

— [EFTA01773851](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01773851.pdf)

This confirms that Epstein and Stern had already met someone from the Elkann/Agnelli orbit in London prior to October 2011.

**December 2012 — Boris Nikolic asks about Elkann:**

Boris Nikolic (Gates Foundation science advisor, later named as alternate executor of Epstein's will) asked Epstein if he knew people from a list including: *"John Elkann (CEO of Exor and Chairman of Fiat) and Sergio Marchionne"* ([EFTA01974471](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01974471.pdf)).

**April 2015 — "The New Target":**

> *"john elkann -- has heard great things about him from a friend; I know that he is Lapo's brother.. what do you think?"*
>
> Epstein: *"great great great"*
>
> **"I think he is the new target. How do we meet him? Not through Edu for sure"**

— [EFTA02389138](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02389138.pdf)

The word "target" signals deliberate cultivation. "Not through Edu" explicitly names Teodorani as the existing channel to the Agnelli family — but proposes bypassing him to reach John Elkann directly.

On the **same day**, Epstein pitched EXOR to a Qatari contact:

> *"shabaz could look at the details of EXOR. the owner of cushman, agnelli family holding. they just bid for an re insurance co last week, they will spin off ferrari this year. and will have fiat chrysler.maserati. most of their money is liquid. 15billion or so."*

— [EFTA02504407](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02504407.pdf)

Epstein was simultaneously cultivating access to Elkann AND pitching EXOR as an investment opportunity to Gulf sovereign wealth.

**September 2017 — "Tell him we are friends":**

> A contact: *"I've been shooting Lapo Elkann today with photographer"*
>
> Epstein: **"you can tell him we are friends"**

— [EFTA02633429](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02633429.pdf)

[Lapo Elkann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapo_Elkann) — John Elkann's brother, the flamboyant Fiat heir and fashion designer — was being positioned as an access point. Epstein instructed his contact to claim a friendship.

**January 2014 — Lapo Elkann art event:**

An invitation forwarded through Teodorani's CNH office for a London gallery reception: *"LAPO ELKANN // WAYNE MASER // THE ITALIAN // ROBILANT AND VOENA"*. Epstein declined. ([EFTA02114794](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02114794.pdf))

**Ginevra Elkann and the Edge Foundation:**

[Ginevra Elkann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginevra_Elkann) (John's sister, the filmmaker) appeared on John Brockman's [Edge Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_Foundation) email distribution list alongside Epstein, Gates, Bezos, Page, Brin, Musk, and Zuckerberg ([EFTA01764323](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01764323.pdf)).

Brockman wrote to Epstein in June 2012: *"Next week it's Turin — the first EDGE event in Italy, Tuesday night, July 10, hosted by Ginevra Elkann, Agnelli's grand-daughter. Craig Venter is speaking."* ([EFTA01876948](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01876948.pdf))

**May 2018 — Chateau l'Horizon:**

Epstein was looking at **[Chateau l'Horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_de_l%27Horizon)** — the Agnelli family's legendary Riviera villa — as architectural inspiration, working with London architect John Heah ([EFTA02246355](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02246355.pdf)).

---

### David Stern: The European Deal Intermediary

David Stern ran **Asia Gateway Ltd.** from Michelin House, 81 Fulham Road, London SW3. He functioned as Epstein's European deal scout — mapping investment opportunities, leveraging Epstein's JPMorgan connections, and seeking capital for his own ventures.

**Stern's key Italian-related activities:**

- **Elkann/EXOR Asia platform mapping** (October 2011): Meeting Tobias Brown in Hong Kong to understand EXOR's Asian investment infrastructure, reporting back to Epstein ([EFTA01773851](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01773851.pdf))

- **Endemol/Cyrte restructuring** (March 2012): Stern brought Epstein a €100–200M deal opportunity. Endemol equity (owned by Goldman Sachs, Berlusconi's media group, and [Cyrte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talpa_Network) — John de Mol's institutional fund) had defaulted. Total debt: €1.8 billion, enterprise value approximately €1.1 billion. Cyrte and Apollo were buying senior debt; an investor was needed to join forces. ([EFTA01997190](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01997190.pdf), [EFTA01989436](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01989436.pdf))

- **"Financial Trust" / JPMorgan positioning** (September 2009): Stern drafted language describing himself as heading European investments for Epstein's "Financial Trust" entity, *"the independent, private investment arm of JP Morgan"* — language Epstein vetoed: *"no lets talk"* ([EFTA01817480](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01817480.pdf))

## Part 4: The Social Circuit — Maxwell, Briatore, and Sardinia

### Flavio Briatore: A Direct Friendship

[Flavio Briatore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavio_Briatore) — the Italian businessman, former Benetton/Renault F1 team principal, ex-partner of Naomi Campbell and Heidi Klum, and founder of the Billionaire Club in Sardinia — maintained a personal relationship with both Epstein and Maxwell.

**August 2001 — Joint Mayo Clinic trip:**

Maxwell wrote to "Tom" (Tom Pritzker) about planning a medical visit:

> *"Regarding the Mayo, actually Flavio sd he would organise but I am not sure if it is better he does or you do. Regardless, what Flavio sd was that we should all go beofre the Indianapolis race which is the 28/29/30 Sept."*

Tom replied: *"I need full name for Flavio and preferred dates for appointment at Mayo. My instructions, as I understand it, are to get appts for the three of you (Jeffrey, Flavio and you)."*

— [EFTA00581216](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00581216.pdf)

Epstein, Maxwell, and Briatore were planning a joint Mayo Clinic visit, coordinated to precede the [2001 United States Grand Prix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_United_States_Grand_Prix) at Indianapolis (September 30, 2001). Briatore was managing the Renault F1 team. Tom Pritzker (of the [Pritzker family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pritzker_family)) was coordinating appointments.

**Maxwell and the Billionaire Club:**

> *"Umy, long time no speak. Are you gong to be in Moscow 13/14/15 July? Or are you going to be in Sardinia for the opening of the Billionaire club?"*

— Maxwell, [EFTA00579708](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00579708.pdf)

The [Billionaire Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire_(nightclub)) (now "Billionaire") was Briatore's famous Porto Cervo nightclub on Sardinia's Costa Smeralda, which opened in 1998.

**October 2010 — "My Italian friend":**

In a helicopter sale negotiation, when told the buyer "Mr. Fhyad from Harrods" (Mohamed Al-Fayed) was interested, Epstein responded:

> *"he knows flavio briatore. my itialin frined.."*

— [EFTA01981380](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01981380.pdf)

Epstein explicitly claimed Briatore as **his** friend — not merely Maxwell's social contact.

**May 2010 — The Fergie/Prince Andrew connection:**

Epstein sent Maxwell a link to the News of the World sting in which the Duchess of York was caught selling access to Prince Andrew, adding: **"also google briatore"**. Maxwell asked: *"That is devastating..have u spoken to her?"*. Epstein: *"no, but i have lots of info. I do not want this to lead to me.. just what i need."* ([EFTA00734672](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00734672.pdf))

Briatore had been publicly linked to the Fergie sting — the undercover reporter's cover story involved the F1/high-society circuit that Briatore inhabited. Epstein was tracking how the scandal overlapped with his own orbit.

**Other references:**

- Epstein knew Briatore's Chelsea triplex details and shared this real estate intelligence with Lord Mandelson ([EFTA01826946](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01826946.pdf))
- Epstein correctly identified Briatore from photos when others misidentified him as a Renault executive, and knew his romantic history (Klum, Campbell) ([EFTA01905717](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01905717.pdf))
- A correspondent noted Briatore "also spent time in st Thomas" — connecting him to the U.S. Virgin Islands ([EFTA02564734](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02564734.pdf))

**Direct contact pattern:** No direct Epstein-to-Briatore emails were found in the corpus. All references are Epstein talking about Briatore to others, or Maxwell coordinating with Briatore through Tom Pritzker. Their direct communications were likely via phone or in-person channels not captured in these datasets.

### Sardinia: The Travel Pattern

Sardinia recurs across the corpus from 2001 through 2018:

**August 2010 — Epstein in Sardinia, coordinating flights:**

A remarkable text message sequence shows Epstein physically in Sardinia, requesting flights from Olbia airport:

> *"The best flight I could find leaves Olbia airport in Sardinia tomorrow morning at 7am, a 2 hour layover in Rome and arrives Newark at 1:30pm for $2,044."*

— Epstein's assistant, [EFTA00677652](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00677652.pdf)

The sequence shows Epstein coordinating travel for young women between Sardinia and St. Thomas (USVI) — the same integration of European and Caribbean destinations documented elsewhere in the corpus.

**August 2011 — Rome to Sardinia:**

> **Epstein**: *"we will be in rome until mon afternoon"*
>
> **Maxwell**: *"Go straight to sardinia Sunday"*

— [EFTA00687603](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00687603.pdf)

This was the same weekend as the planned Valentini meeting. Maxwell was directing Epstein's travel to Sardinia from Rome.

The same week, Epstein asked Maxwell: *"have you seen anyone interesting in sardinia??"* ([EFTA02012669](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02012669.pdf))

**August 2013 — Jes Staley reports from Sardinia:**

> *"We got back from Sardinia last night. What a great week with the family on the boat. Beautiful part of the world. The number of Russian and Arab mega yachts was amazing."*

— Jes Staley to Epstein, [EFTA01959011](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01959011.pdf)

**June 2018 — Cancelled Sardinia trip:**

As late as June 2018 — thirteen months before Epstein's arrest — a Sardinia trip was being planned through American Express Centurion concierge services and then cancelled when Epstein needed to be in New York ([EFTA00476730](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00476730.pdf)).

### The Rome → Sardinia → Paris Circuit

The documents reveal a consistent Mediterranean travel pattern:
- **Rome**: Political meetings (Berlusconi circle, Bannon), social events (Woody Allen dinners), "girl suggestions" from Italian contacts
- **Sardinia**: Briatore's Billionaire Club, Berlusconi's Villa Certosa, yacht culture, Costa Smeralda
- **Paris**: Epstein's base for European operations — his apartment was the hub where Teodorani, Bannon, Junkermann, and others converged

---

## Part 5: Jacob Burda and the Hedosophia Origin Story

### Introduction Through Ian Osborne

Jacob Burda — son of **Hubert Burda**, the German media billionaire who owns [Burda Media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Burda_Media) (Focus magazine, HuffPost Germany, etc.) — was introduced to Epstein through Ian Osborne, who described him as his **"young protege"**:

> *"my young protege Jacob Burda is friends with Karl Lagerfeld who suggested we see him in Paris this weekend. I am sure you and he would have lots to talk about..."*

— Osborne to Epstein, September 30, 2011, [EFTA01852403](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01852403.pdf)

Epstein, Osborne, and Burda planned a Paris meeting, potentially including Lagerfeld at a Chanel show run-through: *"Lagerfeld is doing a run-through of the Chanel show from midnight to 2am tomorrow"* ([EFTA02029485](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02029485.pdf)).

### Epstein's Direct Role in Founding Hedosophia

Osborne and Burda co-founded **[Hedosophia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedosophia)**, a technology investment firm. Epstein was directly involved from its earliest stages.

**The name:**

> *"Jacob is rather attached to 'hedosophia' which I actually like. It just merges the Greek works for 'pleasure' and 'wisdom'. We prefer this to the blander 'partnership 53' because we want to establish a brand in elite circles."*

Epstein: *"i don't care about the name, there are many things to think about names are not one of them"*

— [EFTA01843639](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01843639.pdf)

**Legal review:**

Epstein's lawyers reviewed all formation documents for **Hedosophia Alpha Limited ("HAL")**, a 50/50 joint venture between Osborne and Burda registered in Guernsey (Channel Islands), targeting $50–80M in consumer internet investments ([EFTA01842917](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01842917.pdf), [EFTA01842514](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01842514.pdf)).

**Closing strategy:**

> *"i think your timing for a friday close is optomistic, my tummy tells me you should close with your solina burda and kuoks. immediatly.. Ill be on the call."*
>
> *"as the security laws, facta, dodd frank, are all set to cause issues.. I think we might consider, as most funds do, having me as an onshore food and your others stay offshore. never touch the states.."*

— Epstein to Osborne, [EFTA01840955](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01840955.pdf)

Epstein advised immediate closing with existing investors: the Burda family, **Solina Chau** (Hong Kong billionaire and Li Ka-shing associate), and the **Kuok family** (Hong Kong/Malaysia billionaire dynasty). He suggested structuring himself as the onshore investor while keeping others offshore to avoid U.S. regulatory issues. He planned to be on the closing call.

**February 2012 — Burda in Italy:**

> *"Hey Jeffrey, I'm currently in the land of Berlusconi preparing for my Philosophy of Physics application at Oxford. Doing quite well on the fun side I think, although by your standards you surely wouldn't be too impressed..."*

— Burda to Epstein, [EFTA01842585](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01842585.pdf)

**Science network integration:**

Osborne and Burda were invited to Epstein's elite science symposia alongside Marvin Minsky, Martin Nowak, Lawrence Krauss, Steven Pinker, Seth Lloyd, and Alan Kay ([EFTA02013490](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02013490.pdf)).

### Later Trajectory

Hedosophia went on to become one of the most prominent SPAC sponsors of the late 2010s, most notably taking [Virgin Galactic public](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Galactic) via an $800M SPAC deal in 2019. Whether Epstein maintained any financial interest after the formation period is not documented in the corpus.

---

## Part 6: Jean Pigozzi and the Edge Foundation (Summary)

**[Jean Pigozzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Pigozzi)** — the Italian-French billionaire heir to the Simca automobile fortune — maintained direct personal email correspondence with Epstein spanning at least May 2013 to April 2014. Their exchanges included photos of their respective properties, discussions of women's physical appearances, and travel coordination through Paris and the South of France.

Pigozzi's 259-document footprint includes 76 Edge Foundation/John Brockman dinner invitations listing both men alongside Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk. Maxwell testified in her deposition that she attended Sergey Brin's birthday party on Pigozzi's Caribbean island with approximately 30–50 guests, Elon Musk among them.

Epstein served as the conduit through which his co-defendant Jean-Luc Brunel obtained Pigozzi's phone number.

**For full analysis, see the [dedicated Pigozzi investigation](../social-networks/PIGOZZI_EDGE_FOUNDATION.md).**

---

## Part 7: What's NOT There

An honest assessment of what the Italian thread does **not** contain:

1. **Zero Italian politicians appear in direct personal contact with Epstein.** No Salvini, no Meloni, no Grillo, no Berlusconi. Bannon met Italian politicians; Epstein advised Bannon remotely. The Berlusconi meeting was brokered through Osborne and Valentini — there is no evidence Epstein and Berlusconi ever communicated directly.

2. **No Italian banking accounts.** UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo appear only in wire transfer metadata — as correspondent banks or intermediaries, not as banks where Epstein held accounts.

3. **No MC2 modeling pipeline to Italy.** MC2 Model Management's documented recruitment focused on Eastern Europe (Brazil, Slovakia, Czech Republic). While stranded Russian-speaking models in Italy appear in the Junkermann report, this reflects Italy as a transit point, not a recruitment target.

4. **No Mafia/organized crime connections.** Despite the Italian setting, nothing in the corpus suggests connections to organized crime.

5. **No Corona, no Signorini, no Meloni.** Several names that Italian searchers might look for — Fabrizio Corona (celebrity photographer/fixer), Alfonso Signorini (gossip magazine editor), Giorgia Meloni — simply do not appear in the corpus.

6. **Bannon met Italian politicians, but no evidence Epstein attended or participated.** Epstein advised by iMessage from wherever he was; there is no documentation that he was present at any meeting with an Italian political figure.
