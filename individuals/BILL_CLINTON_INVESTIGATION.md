# Bill Clinton — The Operational Infrastructure

*How the Clinton-Epstein relationship actually functioned: Maxwell as intermediary, Band as operational counterpart, Epstein as diplomatic back-channel, and the coordinated denial when it all threatened to go public.*

---

## What's Already Known

The Clinton-Epstein connection is the most widely reported thread in the Epstein saga. The relationship dates to at least 1993: White House visitor logs show Epstein visited the Clinton White House [at least 17 times between 1993 and 1995](https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeffrey-epstein-visited-president-bill-clinton-17-times-white-house-visitor-logs-show/), mostly meeting aide Mark Middleton. On September 29, 1993, Epstein and Maxwell attended a White House donors' reception after Epstein donated $10,000 to the White House Historical Association — [three photographs from that evening](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/clinton-epstein-maxwell/) show Clinton with Epstein and Maxwell. At least [11 images of Clinton socializing with Epstein and Maxwell](https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/what-the-epstein-files-say-about-bill-clinton/) have surfaced across various productions.

Clinton flew on Epstein's planes at least 26 times across four international trips in 2002–2003 ([Fox News, May 2016](https://www.foxnews.com/us/flight-logs-show-bill-clinton-flew-on-sex-offenders-jet-much-more-than-previously-known)). On at least five Asia trip legs, no Secret Service agent was listed on the manifest ([Washington Times, May 2016](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/14/bill-clinton-ditched-secret-service-on-multiple-lo/)). The September 2002 Africa trip carried Kevin Spacey, Chris Tucker, Ghislaine Maxwell, Doug Band, and Ron Burkle on Epstein's Boeing 727 for Clinton Foundation HIV/AIDS work. Clinton gave a glowing quote to New York Magazine: "Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a committed philanthropist."

Maxwell played a "very central" role in setting up the Clinton Global Initiative, per her own DOJ interview ([CNN, Aug 2025](https://us.cnn.com/2025/08/24/politics/kfile-ghislaine-maxwell-clinton-conference-vis)). A $1 million wire went to Publicis Groupe for the inaugural CGI event ([NYT/GV Wire, Feb 2026](https://gvwire.com/2026/02/09/epstein-files-reveal-scope-of-ghislaine-maxwells-role-in-clinton-circle/)). Epstein's lawyers claimed during 2007 plea negotiations that he was "part of the original group that conceived the Clinton Global Initiative." Maxwell was honored at CGI in September 2013 — years after sexual misconduct allegations were public.

The Band-Maxwell email relationship has been reported in broad strokes: flirtatious exchanges, a $35,000 Audemars Piguet watch Epstein directed Maxwell to buy for Band, Band requesting use of Maxwell's plane for the NCAA Final Four ([Florida Alligator, Jan–Feb 2026](https://www.alligator.org/article/2026/01/doug-band-uf-epstein-maxwell-documents); [CNN, Feb 2026](https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/01/politics/epstein-files-clintons); [DropSite News, Dec 2025](https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/jeffrey-epstein-hillary-bill-clinton-ghislaine-maxwell)). Band told the New York Times the communications occurred when he was "in his late 20s and unmarried," denied a physical relationship, and called Maxwell "a monster."

No flight records place Clinton on Epstein's island. The U.S. Secret Service FOIA response found no evidence Clinton ever visited Little St. James. Former FBI Director Louis Freeh's defense-commissioned report concluded the same.

As of this writing, the House Oversight Committee is deposing both Clintons under the Epstein Files Transparency Act. [Hillary Clinton testified on February 26, 2026](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/hillary-clinton-deposition-house-oversight-jeffrey-epstein-probe-rcna260435), stating she never met Epstein and had no new information. [Bill Clinton's deposition is scheduled for February 27, 2026](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/bill-clinton-house-epstein-probe-rare-testimony-former-president-rcna260436) — the first time a former president has been compelled to testify to Congress. The Clintons initially defied subpoenas, leading to a [bipartisan contempt recommendation](https://oversight.house.gov/release/chairman-comer-announces-the-clintons-caved-will-appear-for-depositions/), before agreeing to appear. The five agreed topic areas include Epstein's relationships with Clinton associates and any knowledge of Epstein's criminal conduct ([CNN, Feb 25, 2026](https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/25/politics/how-bill-hillary-clinton-are-preparing-depositions-jeffrey-epstein)).

This report focuses on what hasn't been reported.

## 1. Maxwell as Clinton Operations Hub

The EFTA production contains dozens of emails between Maxwell and **Doug Band** spanning December 2001 through October 2004. Band wrote from his Office of William Jefferson Clinton email address, tagged "(WJC wjc)." These go far beyond the flirtatious tone already reported. They show Maxwell functioning as the **central node** connecting the Clinton operation to Epstein's world — managing logistics, relaying messages, coordinating schedules, and routing financial requests.

### The Motorcade-to-Plane Pipeline

On February 6, 2002, Band emailed Maxwell about departure logistics from a Miami party:

> *"Hopefully, 830 or 9 departure from phils. We will take you guys from phils to the plane obviously in our motorcade."*
> — [EFTA02332312](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02332312.pdf)

"Phils" is **Phil Esformes**, the Miami healthcare executive later convicted in a [$1 billion Medicare fraud case](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/florida-health-care-facility-owner-sentenced-20-years-prison-role-13-billion-health-care). The "plane" is Epstein's aircraft. The "motorcade" is Bill Clinton's Secret Service detail.

Maxwell coordinated Epstein's end of the logistics:

> *"JE is not coming to the party as he is a hermit. This means that I am going to drive to Miami for the party and he will fly in to Miami to pick us up — I will need to give him a time to be in position — alternatively maybe the answer is that once at the party your boss gives you a heads up 45 mins before he wants to leave and then that gives me time to tell everyone and get the plane in position"*
> — [EFTA02333390](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02333390.pdf)

Maxwell refers to Clinton as "your boss." In a follow-up email, Band asked *"So pritzker is not in miami tonight?"* and Maxwell confirmed: *"Yes you are right Tom is not in Miami"* ([EFTA02333392](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02333392.pdf)) — **Tom Pritzker** was expected but absent that night. The operational chain: Clinton's motorcade picks up Maxwell from Esformes's property → delivers her to Epstein's plane → Epstein flies the group out. A former president's security detail serving as the first leg of transport to a sex offender's aircraft.

### The April 2003 Dinner — Google Founders at Epstein's House

In April 2003, Band — writing from the WJC email — vetted guests for a dinner at Epstein's Manhattan residence that Clinton might attend:

> *"Doubtful be he may just come in for a lunch that day. I need a full list and bios of everyone coming, time and at je's house?"*
> — [EFTA02332565](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02332565.pdf)

Maxwell supplied the guest list, including **Sergey Brin**:

> *"Sergey Brin founding father of Google — not really father as he is annoyingly only 30"*

Band corrected her:

> *"Got em all. Anyone else invited that may come? Fyi, eric schmidt is founder of google, big supporter of ours"*
> — [EFTA02332569](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02332569.pdf)

Band conceded the next day: *"My bad, you were right as always, eric just runs google"* ([EFTA02332575](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02332575.pdf)). The phrase "big supporter of ours" identifies Schmidt as a Clinton donor.

That Brin attended dinners at Epstein's house has been reported ([CNBC, Feb 2026](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/09/tech-leaders-epstein-records-silicon-valley-sergey-brin-thiel-sinofsky-reid-hoffman-musk-gates.html)). What hasn't been reported is that **Doug Band performed advance-team vetting of the guest list from Clinton's office email**, placing the Clinton operation directly in the logistics of an Epstein dinner party.

A separate email in the same thread reveals Epstein controlled the guest list: *"JE invited Fred Fekkai and sd he could invite whom ever he wanted — he invited Brenda"* ([EFTA02332573](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02332573.pdf)). **Philip Levine** — later mayor of Miami Beach — was also in the mix, described as "bringing the brit to je's" ([EFTA02332574](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02332574.pdf)).

### The $250K Payment Request

On March 18, 2004, at 3:45 AM, Band emailed Maxwell:

> *"Attias met with mary today. She likes him a lot, smart of him. They talked money and mary was shy about it and they talked low six figures, I would like to see her do better. Thx, its imp for wjc/me to get her taken care of. She did a lot in the old days... Surely he's paying people tons so 250k shouldn't be out of the question"*
> — [EFTA02332671](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02332671.pdf)

Band is asking Maxwell to help get **Richard Attias** — the Publicis Events executive who organized Clinton Global Initiative events — to pay $250,000 to a woman named "Mary" who "did a lot in the old days" for Clinton. Band says it's "important for wjc/me to get her taken care of." Maxwell is the intermediary between Clinton's aide and a major event organizer — routing financial requests through the Epstein-adjacent network.

A separate email confirms Attias viewed Maxwell and Epstein as a unit. When "Darren" demanded detailed budgets for a WJC project Publicis was financing, Attias complained directly to Maxwell:

> *"I trust you and JE at 300% they must trust us!"*
> — [EFTA02333013](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02333013.pdf)

Epstein was in the financial chain of a Clinton project, and Attias's trust in the arrangement was explicitly tied to both Maxwell and Epstein.

### The Prince Andrew Triangle

Maxwell served as the connector between the Clinton and Andrew orbits. Band coordinated with Andrew through Maxwell:

> *"Andrew is staying in our hotel in scotland and we are reaching out to him to see if he wants to play golf with me and my boss tom"*
> — [EFTA02332307](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02332307.pdf)

"My boss tom" — likely Bill Clinton, though the lowercase "tom" has prompted debate about whether it's a name or a typo. Band wrote from his Office of William Jefferson Clinton email address.

After Andrew hosted a dinner for Clinton, Band asked Maxwell for the address to send a thank-you note: *"Julie would like andrews address to send a ty for dinner for clinton."* Maxwell replied: *"HRH Prince Andrew"* ([EFTA02333550](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02333550.pdf)). In April 2004, Maxwell invited Band to dinner with Andrew at "the spice bar" in New York ([EFTA02333272](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02333272.pdf)).

Tom Pritzker forwarded Maxwell a GLOBE tabloid article describing Clinton and Maxwell at a dinner together: *"Clinton was sitting next to her, playing Prince Charming, offering to pour her wine and laughing heartily at everything she said"* ([EFTA02333209](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02333209.pdf)).

**Ted Waitt** relayed Clinton's personal interest in Maxwell: *"Clinton asked how you were"* ([EFTA02333120](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02333120.pdf)). Maxwell managed Clinton's schedule through Band: *"Spoke to Doug about Clinton meeting Maurice [Levy, CEO of Publicis] when he is here. It will not work as it is too close to the election"* ([EFTA02333354](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02333354.pdf)).

### Regular Meetings at Epstein's House

As late as October 2004, Maxwell was scheduling meetings between Band and Epstein at Epstein's home:

> *"JE says mon night at 6 his house — does that work for you"*
> — [EFTA02333113](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02333113.pdf)

Band confirmed: *"Perfecto."* This was not ancient history — it was ongoing.

## 2. Epstein as Diplomatic Back-Channel

After his 2008 conviction, Epstein lost most of his public-facing network. What the EFTA corpus reveals is that his **diplomatic brokering role** continued undiminished.

### The Sarkozy-Clinton Meeting Request (November 2013)

On November 5, 2013, **Olivier Colom** — an international advisor at the **Edmond de Rothschild Group** and [former deputy diplomatic adviser to Nicolas Sarkozy](https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260206-who-from-france-political-cultural-elite-named-epstein-files) — emailed Epstein:

> *"Could you organise a discreet meeting between Sarko and Hillary Clinton in NY? If not, who should we ask?"*

Epstein replied:

> *"meetings with Hillary are not easily discreet. when?"*
> — [EFTA01949592](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01949592.pdf)

This is a senior figure at one of Europe's most prominent banking dynasties asking a **registered sex offender** to broker a meeting between a former French president and a former U.S. Secretary of State who was the presumptive 2016 Democratic nominee. Epstein didn't refuse — he raised a practical concern and asked about timing.

Colom followed up the next day: *"whenever possible from December"* and mentioned he *"might come soon to NY and Wash — for contacts with US dept of Justice and Treasury"* ([EFTA01950628](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01950628.pdf)). The Sarkozy-Clinton meeting was part of a broader set of high-level government contacts. Epstein signaled willingness: *"lets speak."*

This email has appeared in European press ([Irish Times, Feb 2026](https://www.irishtimes.com/world/us/2026/02/26/hillary-clinton-to-testify-as-epstein-inquiry-forces-her-back-into-the-spotlight/); [France 24, Feb 2026](https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260206-who-from-france-political-cultural-elite-named-epstein-files)) and on social media, but no major U.S. outlet has reported on it in depth.

### The Ivory Coast Scheduling Conflict (January 2012)

In January 2012, Epstein was arranging a meeting in Ivory Coast with President **Alassane Ouattara** through an intermediary identified as "Nina K." She informed Epstein:

> *"He said the 17th is a perfect date. Apparently Hilary Clinton would also be here the same day as you (and i guess you know her pretty well)."*
> — [EFTA01843361](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01843361.pdf)

Epstein's response was immediate:

> *"I do not want to be there the same day as hillary"*

Nina K. pushed back:

> *"Jeffrey this is going to be tough because i already told him that you'll come and i really don't know what to say anymore. You won't meet her and he doesn't know that you know each other."*
> — [EFTA01990648](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01990648.pdf)

The Ivorian president didn't know Epstein and Clinton knew each other. Epstein rearranged his schedule to avoid overlap, agreeing to arrive on the 16th and leave the night of the 17th.

The logistics email from Epstein's pilot "Larry" confirms the trip happened:

> *"Plus Hilary Clinton arrives Monday night into Abidjan according to Mr. Toekoff, so security will be high."*

The pilot was instructed to park Epstein's plane at the **Air Force Base** rather than the civilian side of the airport, coordinated through **General Ouegnin**, who ran the Abidjan airport ([EFTA02032177](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02032177.pdf)).

Nina K. offered to arrange additional meetings with Ivory Coast's **Minister of Interior Hamed Bakayoko** and **Minister of Mines and Energy Adama Toungara**. In the same email thread, Epstein name-dropped **Thorbjorn Jagland** (Secretary General of the Council of Europe and chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Peace Prize Committee) and the Kazakh foreign minister as contemporaneous contacts.

A registered sex offender, three years after conviction, parking his private jet at a military airbase in West Africa, meeting the president, scheduling around the U.S. Secretary of State's visit, with ministerial-level access and Nobel committee connections. This has never been reported. [Al Jazeera (Feb 27, 2026)](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/27/did-epstein-help-israel-push-for-a-security-deal-with-ivory-coast) covered the Barak/Israel angle of Epstein's Ivory Coast activities but did not mention the Clinton scheduling overlap.

## 3. The Island Contradiction

### The FBI 302 (March 2011)

On March 17, 2011, FBI agents interviewed a victim at the U.S. Consulate in Sydney, Australia, under case number 31E-MM-108062. The resulting FD-302 — a 37-page document drafted July 5, 2013 — contains this passage on page 17:

> *"[She] met numerous famous people while she was with EPSTEIN including academics, politicians, and celebrities. She met BILL CLINTON and AL GORE and TIPPER GORE at EPSTEIN's private island. [She] did not engage in sexual activity with CLINTON or GORE."*
> — [EFTA01688359](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01688359.pdf), page 17

This is a formal law enforcement record. The same 302 contains detailed accounts of recruitment at Mar-a-Lago (victim was approximately 15–16), sexual encounters with Prince Andrew at three separate locations, a description of three 12-year-old French girls sent to Epstein as a "birthday gift," and positive photo identifications of Alan Dershowitz, Al Gore, Leslie Wexner, and Jean-Luc Brunel.

The victim's allegations about Clinton on the island have been reported via Virginia Giuffre's depositions and media interviews ([Newsweek, Jan 2024](https://www.newsweek.com/bill-clinton-jeffrey-epstein-allegation-documents-island-1857652); [ABC News, Nov 2025](https://abcnews.com/Politics/bill-clinton-jeffrey-epstein/story?id=127629827)). But this specific FBI 302 — taken under oath at a U.S. consulate, with an AUSA on the phone — has not been singled out as primary source material.

### Epstein's Coordinated Denial (January 2015)

When the victim's allegations went public in January 2015, Epstein dispatched the same denial to multiple contacts on the same day — Clinton was never on the island — escalating from casual dismissal to an organized defense strategy.

To **David Stern**:

> *"pa people could showcase the lack of her credibility as in the story she details a dinner with clinton on my island down to where he was sitting howver it never ever happened CLINTON was never on the island the story , hell is all a total fiction. it could help shred her story."*
> — [EFTA01747912](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01747912.pdf)

To **Joi Ito** (then director of the MIT Media Lab):

> *"bad press in fulll swing. she also claims to have dinner on my island with clinton. lots of details where he was Sitting etc however he was NEVER on the island NEVER. its silly, but she has lots of traction"*
> — [EFTA01747689](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01747689.pdf)

Ito relayed the Dershowitz defense strategy: *"they picked the wrong adversary in Dersh. It will be his new life mission."*

To **Ghislaine Maxwell**, in an email titled "joint defense agreement," Epstein laid out an 8-point strategy document proposing to deploy an unnamed former girlfriend as a defense witness. Point 5:

> *"she knows clinton was never on the island. she knows no sex with steven hawking, she knows no sex with ehud as he was also never on the island."*
> — [EFTA01747366](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01747366.pdf)

The same email claimed Jane Does 1 and 2 were *"local strippers, that would call all the time asking if they could do massages."* Maxwell replied with tactical advice: *"Do not attachk jane doe's makes you look bad."* She articulated her own planned defense: *"My job was to manage contruction of the houses and manage households."*

Individual emails from the January 2015 denial have been reported ([NBC News, 2025](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/epstein-emails-trump-bill-clinton-prince-andrew-what-documents-say-rcna243526); [The Hill, 2025](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5603820-epstein-denies-clinton-island-visit-emails/)). What hasn't been highlighted is the **coordinated scope** — the same core denial dispatched to multiple contacts on the same day, with the Ito email escalating to emphatic caps ("NEVER on the island NEVER"), alongside a joint defense strategy document proposing witness deployment. This was a PR operation, not a private conversation.

The contradiction stands: an FBI 302 from 2011 records a victim placing Clinton on the island. Epstein denied it categorically in 2015. One of these is wrong.

---

## 4. Deutsche Bank's Clinton Problem

As late as November 2018 — seven months before Epstein's arrest — Deutsche Bank's AML Compliance department was still grappling with what to do about Epstein's political connections.

**Yoonsun Chung**, VP of AML Compliance, wrote in an internal email about Epstein's insurance trust:

> *"He is technically an RCA (relative and close associate) to Prince Andrew and Bill Clinton. Is he still associated with them? To the best of your knowledge, do you think he is exerting influence based on his connection to these PEPs?"*
> — [EFTA01420713](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01420713.pdf)

Under Anti-Money Laundering regulations, "RCA" status to Politically Exposed Persons triggers enhanced due diligence. Chung was offering a pathway to downgrade Epstein's risk classification if the bank could argue he was "no longer associated" with Clinton and Andrew. The trust held $276.65.

A year earlier, in August 2017, the KYC approval memo for four Epstein entities (Southern Financial LLC, Southern Trust Company, Jeffrey Epstein, J. Epstein Virgin Islands Foundation) stated plainly:

> *"There is some negative media against Mr Epstein and he is also maintains a close relationship with Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew."*
> — [EFTA01356008](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01356008.pdf)

Despite these documented risk factors, the KYC was approved by four Deutsche Bank officers. Deutsche Bank was later fined $150 million by the New York Department of Financial Services for compliance failures related to Epstein ([NYDFS Consent Order, July 2020](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2020/07/ea20200706_deutsche_bank_consent_order.pdf)). The general fact that Clinton was a factor in Epstein's PEP designation has been reported in compliance trade press, but the specific internal language — a compliance VP asking whether Epstein is "still associated" with Clinton and Andrew — comes from these EFTA documents.

---

## 5. CGI as Networking Node

Epstein didn't just attend the Clinton Global Initiative. He used it as gravitational infrastructure — a place where his contacts converged, and where his role as connector was most visible.

**Boris Nikolic** — Bill Gates's science adviser, [later named as a backup executor of Epstein's will](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/22/business/boris-nikolic-epstein-will.html) — wrote to **Ehud Barak** with Epstein CC'd:

> *"I will be in NYC that whole week and I look forward to seeing you and catching up — most likely at Jeffrey's — it is more interesting there than at CGI ;)"*
> — [EFTA01961765](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01961765.pdf)

The email thread concerned **Parasight Ltd.**, an Israeli malaria diagnostics startup Barak was promoting to Nikolic, who routed it to the Gates Foundation. Barak confirmed he'd be in New York "for the Clinton GI" in September 2013. The message is clear: Epstein's house was the real conference. CGI was the cover story.

Epstein funded others' CGI attendance. **Robin Solomon** of Mount Sinai Hospital wrote in December 2010:

> *"Your generosity in making it possible for me to attend the CGI in 06 has had very long legs and saved many lives... ALL as a tentacle from that first CGI meeting."*
> — [EFTA01832468](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01832468.pdf)

Solomon credited the CGI connection with launching Mount Sinai surgical teams in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, involving Paul Farmer and a plane loaned by "a good friend of WJC." In the same email, she thanked Epstein for a $25,000 NICU renovation donation. This was two years after his conviction.

As late as September 2011, Epstein casually asked Maxwell: *"are you going to cgi?"* ([EFTA01853411](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01853411.pdf)). Multiple Ehud Barak emails from 2010–2016 reference scheduling meetings with Epstein around "the Clinton convention" or "the Clinton GI."

## 6. The Tone

The Band-Maxwell emails have a texture that deserves documentation beyond the headline quotes already reported.

Band regularly scheduled meetings at Epstein's house through Maxwell: *"Je's ofc left me a msg to call him today"* ([EFTA02332364](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02332364.pdf)). He used her as a relay to Clinton's world and Epstein's simultaneously. She managed the logistics of their overlapping social calendars.

In October 2002, Band invited Maxwell and Epstein to watch Paul McCartney from **Ron Burkle's** suite at the Staples Center: *"Ron has a suite at staples center and we will eat there and watch the mcartney show if you and je are up for it."* He added: *"I will work on afleck"* — meaning Ben Affleck ([EFTA02332356](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02332356.pdf), [EFTA02332357](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02332357.pdf)).

Band and Maxwell's personal relationship was intense. She told him: *"I do not stick my finger in you bottom but 2"* ([EFTA02332339](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02332339.pdf)). He told her: *"I will be your bitch when I'm rich"* ([EFTA02332350](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02332350.pdf)). At 3 AM on October 13, 2004, Maxwell and "Carol" were texting Band after leaving him earlier that evening. Maxwell: *"Loved seeing you just incase you missed it."* Then: *"Carol wants to know if you have slept with a best selling author — Clinton not withstanding."* Band replied: *"Tough one... let me think"* ([EFTA02333083](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02333083.pdf)). Band was *"grabbing a quick bite at diner next to my house"* and *"Going out with steve bing later."* In a later exchange: *"Did I mention how sexy you are and how Carol and I were ploting disgustungs things w/you"* ([EFTA02333108](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02333108.pdf)).

After a press characterization of Maxwell as a "social matchmaker," Band offered his version: *"I would have told them that you are my pimp but that at the same time you are my lover."* Maxwell objected only to the word "social" ([EFTA02333508](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02333508.pdf)).

In August 2018, **Kathy Ruemmler** — [Obama's former White House Counsel](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/author/kathryn-ruemmler) — was in casual email contact with Epstein, making insider jokes about Betty Currie (Clinton's personal secretary during the Lewinsky scandal) and mentioning seeing her *"at the WJC/James Patterson book event"* ([EFTA02605153](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02605153.pdf)).
