## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

David J. Mitchell, operating through Mitchell Holdings LLC, was not merely a peripheral associate of Jeffrey Epstein. The documentary evidence establishes Mitchell as one of the **three named executors of Epstein's 2014 will** (alongside Darren K. Indyke and James E. Staley), a **Trustee of both the 2013 Trust and 2014 Trust** (giving him active fiduciary control during Epstein's lifetime -- distinct from and more powerful than the executor role), a **successor executor in the 2013 will**, and a **direct recipient of at least $580,500 in verified wire transfers** from Epstein's Deutsche Bank accounts between March 2018 and April 2019. Mitchell served as Epstein's real estate proxy, investment scout, property development manager, and financial intermediary -- a role that intersected with Epstein's relationship with former UK politician Peter Mandelson (Lord Mandelson) and was formalized through a November 7, 2017 directive from Epstein instructing Mitchell to "make money" and "clear that cascade will authorize the payments."

This narrative traces every documented payment, communication, and connection.

### 1.1 Identifying Information

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Full Name** | David J. Mitchell |
| **Company** | Mitchell Holdings LLC |
| **Email** | djm@mitchellholdings.com |
| **Address (2009-2012)** | 41 East 60th Street, 6th Floor, New York, NY 10022 |
| **Address (2012-2013)** | 815 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10065 |
| **Address (2017)** | 801 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10065 |

| **Fax** | 212-588-0286 (as of 2010) |

**Note:** Mitchell's office addresses track a pattern of prestigious Manhattan locations -- East 60th Street, Fifth Avenue, Madison Avenue -- consistent with someone operating in high-net-worth real estate transactions.

### 1.2 Role in Epstein's Will -- The Ultimate Trust Marker

**[EFTA00016884](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016884.pdf) -- 2014 Will (The Controlling Document):**

> "THIRD: A. I appoint DARREN K. INDYKE, DAVID MITCHELL and JAMES E. STALEY to be the Executors of this Will. If any one or more of my Executors fails to qualify or ceases to act, I appoint LAWRENCE H. SUMMERS as successor Executor."

Mitchell is named as **CO-EXECUTOR** alongside:
- **Darren K. Indyke** -- Epstein's personal attorney
- **James E. Staley** -- CEO of Barclays Bank ([later forced out over Epstein ties](https://www.reuters.com/business/barclays-ceo-staley-steps-down-2021-11-01/))

**Successor Executor:** [Lawrence H. Summers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers) -- Former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury

**[EFTA00016876](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016876.pdf) -- 2013 Will (Earlier Version):**

> "THIRD: A. I appoint DARREN X. INDYKE, JOSEPH PAGANO and JAMES E. STALEY to be the Executors of this Will. If any one or more of my Executors fails to qualify or ceases to act, I appoint DAVID MITCHELL as successor Executor."

**Evolution of Trust:** Between 2013 and 2014, Mitchell was **promoted** from successor executor to named co-executor, replacing Joseph Pagano. This demonstrates that Mitchell's relationship with Epstein deepened over this period. Being named executor of a multi-hundred-million-dollar estate is an act of extraordinary personal and financial trust. Each executor was to receive $250,000 compensation upon completion of probate.

### 1.3 Role as Trustee -- Active Fiduciary Control (DS9 Discovery)

DS9 reveals Mitchell held a role distinct from and more operationally powerful than executor: **Trustee** of both the 2013 Trust and the 2014 Trust.

- **[EFTA00082247](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00082247.pdf):** The Jeffrey E. Epstein 2013 Trust (full text, 18+ pages) -- Mitchell named as Trustee alongside Indyke and Staley, dated September 16, 2013. Notarized by Harry I. Beller.
- **[EFTA00082273](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00082273.pdf):** The Jeffrey E. Epstein 2014 Trust (full text) -- Mitchell again named as Trustee alongside Indyke and Staley, dated November 18, 2014. Trust provisions include $10M to Karyna Shuliak, $5M each to Brunel and Indyke.
- **[EFTA00082296](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00082296.pdf):** Amendment and Restatement of 2014 Trust, dated May 1, 2015 -- Mitchell signed as Trustee.
- **[EFTA00082267](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00082267.pdf):** First Amendment to 2014 Trust -- Mitchell signed as Trustee. Adds provision that any beneficiary who "was employed by or provided services to me during my lifetime" must receive distribution within one year of death.
- **[EFTA00082266](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00082266.pdf):** Revocation of the 2014 Trust, dated January 30, 2017 -- Mitchell listed as one of three trustees whose acknowledgment was required. (Note: only Indyke's signature is clearly visible in the OCR; Staley and Mitchell have blank date fields on this copy.)
- **[EFTA00099303](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00099303.pdf):** The "1953 Trust," created August 8, 2019, two days before death -- primary trustees are Indyke and Kahn only. Mitchell is demoted to fifth in the successor trustee line (after Nikolic, Barnaby Marsh, Anthony Barrett, and Kathy Reummler). Mitchell also appears in Section 45 (loan forgiveness list) and remains listed as a successor trustee.

As Trustee, Mitchell had active fiduciary control over Epstein's assets during Epstein's lifetime, with authority to distribute principal and income at Epstein's direction. This significantly elevates Mitchell's legal exposure beyond the executor role.

### 1.4 Expanded Real Estate Development Portfolio (DS9 Discovery)

DS9 reveals Mitchell operated at the center of multiple Epstein-funded real estate entities not documented in the original databases:

| Entity | Property | Mitchell Role | Epstein Connection |
|--------|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Mitchell Holdings LLC** | Multiple | Operating company | Mitchell's primary entity |
| **AdvanceStar LLC** | 21 E 26th St (The Chapman) | Managing Member | FT Real Estate (Indyke) held membership interest ([EFTA00300020](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00300020.pdf)) |
| **Lofts 21 LLC** | 21 E 26th St ($13.25M) | Class A Member | AdvanceStar (Mitchell) as Managing Member ([EFTA00306090](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00306090.pdf)) |
| **183 Columbia Holding LLC** | 183 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn | Manager | Property purchased from Watchtower Bible and Tract Society ([EFTA00283892](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00283892.pdf)) |
| **Park Partners Manager LLC** | 320 E 82nd St (Park Mansion) | Manager and Member | FT Real Estate (Indyke) as Member ([EFTA00806988](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00806988.pdf)) |
| **Life Hotel One LLC** | 19 W 31st St | Manager/Operator | Used for Epstein guests at zero charge |

**FT Real Estate, Inc.** -- headquartered at 6100 Red Hook Quarter, Suite B-3, St. Thomas, USVI, with Darren Indyke as Vice President -- was the common capital partner across Mitchell's real estate ventures. This means Epstein's money, channeled through FT Real Estate, funded Mitchell's developments. Mitchell provided operational management; Epstein/Indyke provided capital.

Mitchell had a dedicated file folder tab in Epstein's corporate filing system ([EFTA01221862](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01221862.pdf)), listed alongside core entities like LSJ, Zorro, Jeepers, and Plan D.

## PART II: THE COMPLETE DAVID J. MITCHELL PAYMENT LEDGER

| 4/12/2019 | David J Mitchell | $2,200 | DB-SDNY-0008181 |

**SUBTOTAL (Verified Wire Transfers): $580,500**

### 2.2 Related Mitchell-Family Wire Transfer

| Date | Recipient | Amount | DB-SDNY Bates # |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| 10/26/2017 | Jamie Mitchell | $100,000 | DB-SDNY-0006594 |

**Note:** Jamie Mitchell is confirmed as David Mitchell's **spouse**. DS9 document [EFTA00286410](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00286410.pdf) establishes they jointly own a landmarked home in New York City. [EFTA00688010](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00688010.pdf) shows Jamie Mitchell working as a junior broker on Mitchell's 183 Columbia Heights project (an Epstein/FT Real Estate investment), earning 50% of 0.75% of sales commission. [EFTA01080936](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01080936.pdf) lists Jamie Mitchell as a listing broker for the Park Mansion at 320 East 82nd Street. The $100,000 wire may have been a real estate commission connected to Mitchell's projects.

### 2.3 Payment Pattern Analysis

**Phase 1 (March - September 2018):** Two payments of $50,000 each. Consistent with a retainer or regular consulting fee.

**Phase 2 (October - December 2018):** Four payments totaling $265,000. The $125,000 on 10/11/2018 is the single largest payment. This escalation coincides with the Life Hotel project reaching critical phase.

**Phase 3 (January - April 2019):** Nine payments totaling $215,500. Note the **fragmentation** -- on March 5, 2019 alone, three separate wires ($25,000 + $14,000 + $4,000) were sent. The April payments further fragment to $3,000, $7,800, and $2,200. This pattern of breaking a larger sum into multiple smaller wires could reflect payments for specific invoiced items (consistent with Mitchell's role as property manager handling multiple vendors) or could raise structuring questions, though no structuring charges were filed.

**Epstein's Arrest:** July 6, 2019. The last verified Mitchell payment is April 12, 2019 -- approximately 3 months before arrest. Payments appear to have ceased in the spring of 2019 as federal scrutiny intensified.

## PART III: THE "CASCADE" AUTHORIZATION CHAIN

### 3.1 The Directive -- [EFTA02570991](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02570991.pdf)

**Date:** November 7, 2017, 12:51 AM
**From:** jeffrey E. (jeevacation@gmail.com) -- Jeffrey Epstein
**To:** David Mitchell

> "tomorow you must make money. clear that cascade will authorize the payments. do you have another idea for who can hold the [...]"

**Full OCR Text:**

```
jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com>
Tuesday, November 7, 2017 12:51 AM
David Mitchell

tomorow you must mak[e] mone[y]. clear that cascade will au[thorize]
the payments. do you have another idea for who can hold the [...]

please note
The information contained in this communication is confidential,
may be attorney-client privileged, may constitute inside information,
and is intended only for the use of the addressee. It is the property
of JEE
```

### 3.2 Analysis of the Cascade Directive

This email is extraordinary for several reasons:

1. **"Tomorrow you must make money"** -- Epstein is issuing a direct financial instruction to Mitchell. This is not advisory language; it is a command from a principal to an agent.

2. **"Clear that cascade will authorize the payments"** -- "Cascade" appears to be an entity, authorization layer, or approval mechanism. The instruction to "clear" it suggests Mitchell has the authority or responsibility to unlock payment flows through this entity.

3. **"Do you have another idea for who can hold the [...]"** -- The sentence is cut off, but the question about "who can hold" something (likely funds, property, or an entity) reveals Epstein's use of intermediaries and nominees -- asking Mitchell to identify another person or entity to serve as a holder.

4. **Timing:** This email is sent at 12:51 AM, indicating urgency. The next day, November 8, 2017, was when hotel operating funds were scheduled for release (per [EFTA02571059](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02571059.pdf)).

### 3.3 The "Cascade" Entity

**What is Cascade?**

The term "Cascade" does not appear elsewhere in the four databases searched beyond this single EFTA document. This is significant because:
- It is NOT a publicly known Epstein entity (unlike Southern Trust, Haze Trust, Jeepers Inc., Plan D LLC)
- It may be a **code name** or **informal reference** to a payment authorization process or entity
- The instruction to "clear that cascade will authorize the payments" suggests a **gatekeeper function** -- an entity or mechanism that must approve before funds flow
- In the context of the Life Hotel project (see Part IV), where multiple lenders (Arcade, Crescendo/CREDS) were involved, "Cascade" may refer to a **loan disbursement cascade** or **escrow release mechanism**

### 3.4 Context: The November 2017 Crisis

The Cascade email was sent during a critical period for the Life Hotel project. The surrounding emails paint a vivid picture:

**[EFTA02570917](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02570917.pdf) (November 6, 2017, 11:01 AM):**
- Mitchell to Epstein: "I know you have much more important and by more interesting things to think about, It is appreciated however. Your help is huge to me."
- Epstein responds: "no worry. ill get to him this morning."
- Context: Mitchell is waiting for someone (likely a lender or contractor) to respond, and Epstein is intervening personally.

**[EFTA02571038](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02571038.pdf) (November 5, 2017, 8:57 PM):**
- Epstein forwards to Mitchell a private email from Stephen Henson (construction):
- Epstein to Henson: "got a message that you want to quit? is it a negotiation tactic... we have too much on the line."
- Henson responds: "No. Not quitting. There is not proper funding. David will actually need to show up and oversee this but should be in next few weeks all complete."
- **Key insight:** The contractor identifies a **funding gap** and says Mitchell needs to be more hands-on.

**[EFTA02571059](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02571059.pdf) (November 5, 2017, 6:10 PM) -- The Life Hotel/Restaurant Crisis:**
This is the single most detailed document revealing Mitchell's operational role. It is a long email chain between Mitchell, Stephen Hanson (restaurateur), and Epstein about the Life Hotel at 19 West 31st Street, New York.

---

## PART IV: THE LIFE HOTEL PROJECT -- MITCHELL AS DEVELOPMENT MANAGER

### 4.1 The Property

**Life Hotel, 19 West 31st Street, New York, NY**

Mitchell managed this hotel development project for Epstein. The documentary record in [EFTA02571059](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02571059.pdf) reveals:

- A **CREDS loan of $3.5 million** was obtained as "Preferred Equity"
- Net proceeds after fees: $3,408,000
- Distribution went to: Katsky Korins ($98,000 -- escrow), Arnold & Porter ($30,000 -- legal), Muchnick, Golieb & Golieb P.C. ($25,000 -- legal), and Life Hotel Pref LLC ($3,236,367.70 -- operating entity)
- A restaurant was being opened within the hotel, managed by restaurateur Stephen Hanson

### 4.2 Mitchell's Management Role

From the [EFTA02571059](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02571059.pdf) chain, Mitchell's responsibilities included:

1. **Escrow management:** "ESCROW ACCOUNT at Katsky Korins HAS $722,000 WHICH IS THE $700,000 STATED ABOVE AND $22,000 FOR ALAN'S REIMBURSMENT FOR PAYROLL LAST WEEK"

2. **Contractor payment oversight:** "NEED TO MAKE THE $700,000 WORK, THERE IS NO OTHER FUNDING"

3. **Loan fund allocation:** Mitchell disputed with Hanson about how the Crescendo loan proceeds were allocated: "Then when Crescendo stepped in to advance you the 3.5mm loan - you advised them that $750k was going to the restaurant - this is not correct"

4. **Construction management:** Mitchell coordinated with contractors (Skyland), electricians, plumbers, and building inspectors

5. **Hotel operations oversight:** Mitchell noted: "Denise has mentioned - they are almost out of hair wash and we have run out of slippers weeks ago"

6. **Lock box funding:** "AS YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT UNUSAL AS WE RECEIVE LOCK BOX FUNDING 30 DAYS AFTER IT IS RECIVED"

7. **TCO (Temporary Certificate of Occupancy) pursuit:** Mitchell was responsible for obtaining the TCO from NYC Department of Buildings

### 4.3 Prior Failed Funding -- Arcade

The [EFTA02571059](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02571059.pdf) chain reveals a failed earlier lending relationship:

> "Then in September when you where relaying on Arcade to fund a bridge loan - and we needed funds to complete time and weather sensitive construction items - ie the new roof, sidewalk and other items - which I funded - we both agreed to fund construction with $200k and where to be repaid when Arcade funded. Arcade walked away from the loan and we where never reimbursed."

This establishes:
- Mitchell personally funded $200,000+ in construction costs
- A lender called "Arcade" was expected to fund a bridge loan but withdrew
- Crescendo/CREDS then stepped in with the $3.5M loan
- Mitchell expected reimbursement from the loan proceeds

### 4.4 The Restaurant/Hotel Split Dispute

The documents reveal a bitter dispute between Mitchell and Hanson about:
- How the $3.5M loan was allocated between hotel and restaurant
- Whether $750,000 or $350,000 was designated for the restaurant
- Whether Mitchell was withholding funds or Hanson was mismanaging them
- Hanson threatened to withdraw, telling Mitchell: "let's hear your separation plan"
- Mitchell responded about the two "MOST IMPORTANT FACTS": close out construction/get TCO, and make restaurant funds available

### 4.5 Life Hotel as Epstein Overflow Housing (DS9 Discovery)

DS9 reveals the Life Hotel was actively used to house Epstein's associates, including international visitors, at zero charge:

- **[EFTA00464424](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00464424.pdf) (Nov 17, 2017):** Groff to Mitchell: "Jeffrey is asking if you could check and see if a friend of his who arrives NY city tonight could possibly stay at your Life Hotel for One Night. Her Flight Home is tomorrow evening." Mitchell: "I will make it happen." The guest arrived at JFK on an international flight at ~9pm, departed the next day at 3:30pm on another international flight. Life Hotel confirmation generated at $0.00 room charge.
- **[EFTA00464421](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00464421.pdf) (Nov 17, 2017):** Epstein to Groff: "what apt is [name] staying in. call david mitchell, put her at the life hotel instead." Someone named "Marilyn" was being moved from Epstein's apartment 3M to the Life Hotel.
- **[EFTA00479189](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00479189.pdf) (Aug 6, 2018):** Epstein: "Let's put [name] and friend at life hotel instead of 301." "301" refers to 301 East 66th Street, the building containing Barak's apartment, MC2 offices, and other Epstein-connected units.
- **[EFTA00464351](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00464351.pdf) (Nov 17, 2017):** Mitchell to Denise Luna (Life Hotel General Manager): "I need a VIP room like 1004 or something in the King Deluxe... She is my guest so no payment collected."
- **[EFTA00464261](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00464261.pdf) (Nov 19, 2017):** Groff: "David Mitchell has kindly offered me a room at his Life Hotel!" -- Mitchell also extended hospitality to Epstein's staff.

The pattern of international visitors staying at Epstein-controlled properties at zero charge, with the Life Hotel used as an alternative to the 301 East 66th Street address (which housed MC2 and other Epstein-connected entities), warrants scrutiny. However, the identities and ages of these specific guests are not established in the available documents, and free hotel accommodations for business visitors are not inherently suspicious.

### 4.6 The "Totally Toxic" Email -- [EFTA02518904](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02518904.pdf)

**Date:** March 1, 2018
**From:** David Mitchell to Jeffrey Epstein

> Epstein: "steve asked to come see me tonight. thoughts?"
> Mitchell: "Yes, get me away from him, totally toxic"

This refers to Stephen Hanson and shows Epstein consulting Mitchell about the restaurant partner, with Mitchell urging Epstein to sever the relationship. This demonstrates Mitchell's **advisory influence** over Epstein's business decisions, not merely an employee-employer dynamic.

---

## PART V: MITCHELL AS REAL ESTATE PROXY AND INVESTMENT SCOUT

### 5.1 Proof of Funds Letter -- [EFTA02554189](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02554189.pdf)

**Date:** May 15, 2012
**From:** David Mitchell
**To:** Jeffrey Epstein
**Cc:** Darren Indyke (Epstein's attorney)

> "Dear Jeff, The seller is getting edgy on me and I need to produce this proof funds letter. Was the last edition ok? I would be very thankful if you send it back to me, I have a noon deadline set by them."

**Analysis:** Mitchell was purchasing property using Epstein's financial backing. The "proof of funds letter" is a document showing a buyer has sufficient capital to close a transaction. The fact that Epstein needed to provide this letter, and that Darren Indyke (Epstein's personal attorney) was cc'd, indicates **Epstein was the actual source of funds** while Mitchell was the front-facing buyer. This is a classic nominee/proxy arrangement.

Mitchell's address at the time: 815 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10065.

### 5.2 51% Acquisition -- [EFTA02407336](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02407336.pdf)

**Date:** August 8, 2010
**From:** David Mitchell to Jeffrey Epstein

> "This is for 51 percent. 5-6 groups that make up the 51 percent, depending how you count. Working on the Proxy route as an option as well but that looks like 2.50 and bit more complicated as the Vicis wants a board seat."

Earlier in the chain:
> Mitchell: "I think at max 2.20 (with 3 cent leeway) we get the whole thing. They are holding at 2.50. Need to go back firm to get them to move. What say you"
> Epstein: "doesn't tell me anything... is this your 51% or your partial, who is the they?"

**Analysis:** This reveals Mitchell negotiating a **majority acquisition** of an unnamed entity on Epstein's behalf. Key elements:
- Prices suggest a per-share purchase (possibly a public or private company)
- "Proxy route" suggests an alternative acquisition structure using proxies
- "Vicis wants a board seat" -- a party named Vicis demands governance participation
- Epstein demands transparency: "is this your 51% or your partial, who is the they?"

### 5.3 California/Nama Due Diligence -- [EFTA02422163](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02422163.pdf)

**Date:** September 9-10, 2010
**From:** David Mitchell to Jeffrey Epstein
**Subject:** "Re: California"

Mitchell conducted reference checks on a deal involving a person named "Shawn":

> "I spoke to two out of the 5 so far and all I can say is that your instincts are good. The Nama lawsuit is not the issue (as NAMA was looking to be bought out and started the lawsuit in order to do that) but the low down is that - Shawn is super capable smart guy but 'is too smart for his own good and always looking to better the situation and not afraid of litigation.'"

> "My suggestion is for me to keep working on this deal as it is from the face of it a good deal with potential beyond the projected returns. If possible I think we both should sit down with Samson next week and get answers and go or no go."

> "As I mentioned before, I think if it might be possible to do this in a LLC which we can jointly control with Samson entity."

**Analysis:** Mitchell is functioning as Epstein's **investment scout and due diligence agent** for a California real estate deal. He is checking references, negotiating structures, and proposing joint LLC formations. His contacts include people at "Related" (Related Companies, a major NYC developer) and Silverstein (Silverstein Properties).

### 5.4 82nd Street Investment -- [EFTA02644770](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02644770.pdf)

**Date:** July 12, 2017
**From:** Jeffrey Epstein to David Mitchell

> "rich just showed me your investor letter on 82nd street saying completion in march of 17."

**Analysis:** Mitchell was writing investor letters for a property on 82nd Street, and someone named "Rich" (likely Richard Kahn, Epstein's accountant) showed it to Epstein. DS9 resolves this: the property was **320 East 82nd Street** ("The Park Mansion"), operated through **Park Partners Manager LLC** (Mitchell as Manager) and **Park Partners LLC** (the property-holding entity), with **FT Real Estate, Inc.** (Epstein/Indyke entity in USVI) as the capital partner. The operating agreement ([EFTA00806988](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00806988.pdf), dated June 5, 2015) shows FT Real Estate gets a 20% IRR first, then all excess distributions go to Mitchell. Darren Indyke signed as Vice President of FT Real Estate, confirming Epstein money directly funded this project.

### 5.5 YIVO Institute Introduction -- [EFTA02271386](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02271386.pdf)

**Date:** January 10, 2019
**From:** David Mitchell to Jeffrey Epstein

> "This is the person. Will have Sasha set up by tomorrow. How would you like the intro made."

Mitchell is arranging an introduction to Lyudmila Sholokhova, PhD, Director of Archives and Library at the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research (15 West 16th Street, New York). This shows Mitchell also facilitated Epstein's intellectual/institutional connections.

### 5.6 Martha Stewart Cannabis -- [EFTA02633143](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02633143.pdf)

**Date:** March 1, 2019
**From:** David Mitchell to Jeffrey Epstein

Mitchell forwarded a New York Times article: "Martha Stewart Will Advise Cannabis Grower on Products for Humans and Pets." This was a casual information share, demonstrating the breadth of their regular communication.

## PART VI: THE MITCHELL-MANDELSON-EPSTEIN TRIANGLE

### 6.1 The Peter Mandelsohn Email Thread

A critical cluster of documents ([EFTA02182891](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02182891.pdf), [EFTA02182952](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02182952.pdf), [EFTA02183329](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02183329.pdf), [EFTA02183747](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02183747.pdf), [EFTA02018494](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02018494.pdf)) reveal email correspondence in September 2011 with the subject line **"RE: Peter Mandelsohn"** -- a deliberate or inadvertent misspelling of **Peter Mandelson**.

**[EFTA02183329](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02183329.pdf) -- David Mitchell Email (September 15, 2011):**
- From: David Mitchell
- Subject: "RE: Peter Mandelsohn"
- Date references span September 12-16, 2011
- Additional parties: Curtis, Emily
- The thread involves scheduling and coordination

**[EFTA02182891](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02182891.pdf) -- Related Thread (September 15, 2011):**
- David Mitchell email dated "Thu Sep 15 09:4[7]:41"
- Subject: "Re: Peter Mandelsohn"
- Reference to "Just checking - are we confirmed"
- Address reference: "New York NY 10065" (Mitchell's then-address area)

**[EFTA02182952](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02182952.pdf) -- Extended Thread (September 15-16, 2011):**
- David Mitchell dated "Thu Sep 15 09:47:49 2011"
- Subject includes "Mandelsohn"
- Multiple date references: September 12, 14, 15, 16
- Address: "New York NY 10065" appears multiple times

**[EFTA01854325](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01854325.pdf) -- Todd Boehly Connection:**
- "David Mitchell" <djm@mitchellholdings.com>
- "Sent: Monday September 12 2011 9:09 AM"
- Subject includes "Mandelsohn"
- Recipient includes: "Boehly Todd"
- "Hope you are well"

**Analysis:** This cluster establishes that in September 2011, David Mitchell was coordinating something related to Peter Mandelson (spelled "Mandelsohn"), and the correspondence included **Todd Boehly** ([now owner of Chelsea FC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Boehly), then a Guggenheim Partners executive). DS9 provides the complete email chain including the originating message ([EFTA00427774](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00427774.pdf)): Mitchell asked Boehly about **"bringing Peter into the Irish situation"** -- a specific business proposal, not merely a social introduction. The meeting was originally planned as in-person at Boehly's office (Guggenheim Partners) but was converted to a conference call with Epstein as the moderator ("JE LEADER"). Emily Curtis (Boehly's assistant) notably asked: "can you please remind me of Jeffrey's last name?" -- indicating Curtis did not previously know Epstein.

Additionally, DS9 calendar evidence ([EFTA00304706](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00304706.pdf)) establishes a **February 4, 2011 breakfast** at Epstein's residence: "8:10 Breakfast with David Mitchell and Peter Mandelson." This predates the September 2011 email chain by 7 months and is the first documented in-person meeting among Mitchell, Mandelson, and Epstein.

### 6.2 Peter Mandelson's Relationship with Epstein

The documents establish extensive Epstein-Mandelson contact:

**[EFTA00024275](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024275.pdf) (April 11, 2005):**
- Epstein's phone messages include: "Call Peter Mandelson in Paris on Thursday"
- This is the earliest documented contact

**[EFTA02434424](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02434424.pdf) (November 1, 2009):**
- Mandelson to Epstein re: "Moscow City penthouse"
- Mandelson offers: "Oleg has a great woman who looks after a number of things for him (!) including property. Shall I forward to her for her perusal and view?"
- "Oleg" is very likely **[Oleg Deripaska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleg_Deripaska)**, the Russian oligarch with whom [Mandelson has acknowledged a social relationship](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/22/mandelson-deripaska-yacht)
- This shows Mandelson acting as **intermediary** between Epstein and Russian oligarch property contacts

**[EFTA02434434](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02434434.pdf) (December 9, 2009):**
- Lesley Groff (Epstein's executive assistant) emails: "Jes Staley is wondering time and place for drinks this sat with Peter Mandelson and yourself?"
- This places Mandelson socializing with both Epstein and **Jes Staley** (then JP Morgan executive, [later Barclays CEO](https://www.reuters.com/business/barclays-ceo-staley-steps-down-2021-11-01/), and co-executor of Epstein's will)

**[EFTA02439459](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02439459.pdf) (June 27, 2009):**
- Communication from Epstein to Peter Mandelson: "recorded message"

**[EFTA01779440](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01779440.pdf) (January 13, 2011):**
- "On Thu Jan 13 2011 at 9:35 AM PETER MANDELSON [wrote]"

**[EFTA01794197](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01794197.pdf) (September 8, 2010):**
- "On Wed, Sep 8, 2010 at 5:36 PM, PETER MANDELSON"

**[EFTA02029879](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02029879.pdf) (2011):**
- Subject: "Re: <no subject> she is"
- "at 2:54 PM, Peter Mandelson"

**[EFTA02351725](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02351725.pdf) (July 6, 2012):**
- Mandelson to Epstein: "At centre court wimbledon..."
- Epstein to Mandelson: "Speak?"
- Mandelson's reply from Wimbledon Centre Court demonstrates their casual, frequent communication

**[EFTA02571022](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02571022.pdf) (May 21, 2013):**
- Epstein: "I see you are going to st petersburg. ?"
- Mandelson: "Yes. You?"
- Epstein: "you mean its for gays"
- Mandelson: "It's a rave"
- Response: "Erno, tastey models and dancing"
- Mandelson signs as "Lord Mandelson, Chairman, 38 Wigmore Street, London, W1U 2RU, www.global-counsel.co.uk"

**[EFTA01744877](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01744877.pdf):**
- "Mandelson has joined the ad[visory]..."
- This fragment suggests Mandelson joined an advisory board, possibly for an Epstein-connected entity

**[EFTA00037176](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037176.pdf) -- JPMorgan Report (Press Article in Files):**
- Financial Times article: "Links between Peter Mandelson and Jeffrey Epstein detailed in JPMorgan report"
- "Emails indicate then UK business secretary stayed at New York house while disgraced financier was in prison"
- Internal JPMorgan report filed to 2010
- Photo caption: "Peter Mandelson, left, and Jeffrey Epstein, right, celebrating a birthday at Epstein's Paris apartment in January 2007"

### 6.3 The Triangle: How Mitchell Connects to Mandelson

The documentary evidence establishes this chain:

1. **Mitchell and Epstein** had a deep business relationship spanning 2009-2019 (at minimum), with Mitchell serving as real estate proxy, investment scout, and estate executor.

2. **Mitchell and Mandelson** are directly linked through the September 2011 "Peter Mandelsohn" email thread ([EFTA02183329](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02183329.pdf), [EFTA02182891](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02182891.pdf), [EFTA02182952](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02182952.pdf), [EFTA01854325](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01854325.pdf)), where Mitchell was coordinating something related to Mandelson that also involved Todd Boehly.

3. **Mandelson and Epstein** had a longstanding personal relationship documented across 2005-2013, including socializing, property discussions (Moscow), and Mandelson being referenced in Epstein's phone messages.

4. **The Intermediary Function:** Mitchell, as Epstein's operational manager and trusted agent, appears to have been the person who **operationalized** relationships that Epstein maintained socially. The "Mandelsohn" emails suggest Mitchell was managing logistics for a Mandelson-related business arrangement.

## PART VII: LARRY DELSON AND THE MANDELSON ADVISORY NEXUS

### 7.1 Lawrence "Larry" Delson -- Epstein's Advisory Manager

Larry Delson of **Delson International, Inc.** (P.O. Box 3776, New York, NY 10163) appears extensively in the files as someone who managed advisory and payment relationships for Epstein.

**[EFTA02337293](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02337293.pdf) (October 8-9, 2014):**
- Epstein to Delson: "you should tell eileen that you did not tell me that the money was not going to be paid, and as it was your responsibility to oversee things like this why not pay at least 15m on the 15 and then 10 the 26"
- Delson responds: "OK, I will tell her so but I would have been remiss had I not informed you."
- "Eileen" is likely **Eileen Alexanderson**, who appears as a cc recipient alongside Delson in [EFTA01915572](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01915572.pdf)

**Key documents mentioning Larry Delson:**
- [EFTA01915572](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01915572.pdf) (To: Richard Joslin, Cc: Eileen Alexanderson, lawrence delson)

### 7.2 Delson International Wire Transfers

From the [EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf) payment exhibit:

| Date | Recipient | Amount | DB-SDNY Bates # |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| 10/7/2016 | Delson International Inc. | $50,000 | DB-SDNY-0005747 |
| 10/27/2016 | Delson International Inc. | $50,574 | DB-SDNY-0005749 |

**Total Delson Payments (Documented):** $100,574

### 7.3 The Delson-Mandelson Connection

Larry Delson managed financial relationships for Epstein that included advisory payments to international figures. The Epstein-to-Delson instruction about paying "15m on the 15 and then 10 the 26" suggests Delson oversaw a significant payment schedule. While the specific Mandelson advisory payment has not been directly documented linking Delson as the conduit, the circumstantial evidence is strong:

- Delson managed international advisory payments for Epstein
- Mandelson "joined the advisory" ([EFTA01744877](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01744877.pdf) fragment)
- Mandelson operated through [Global Counsel LLP](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/OC359787) (38 Wigmore Street, London)
- The "Peter Mandelsohn" thread involving Mitchell suggests an advisory arrangement was being coordinated
- "Eileen" (Alexanderson), who appears alongside Delson, was responsible for payments that "were not going to be paid"

## PART VIII: GEORGE MITCHELL (SENATOR) -- SEPARATE EVIDENCE TRAIL

### 8.1 Identity Distinction

**[George J. Mitchell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_J._Mitchell)** -- Former U.S. Senator from Maine (1980-1995), Senate Majority Leader (1989-1995), later Chairman of DLA Piper. He is an entirely different individual from David J. Mitchell.

### 8.2 Abuse Allegations

**[EFTA00022133](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022133.pdf) -- Victims' Allegations Summary:**

> "MBB also alleges Epstein and Maxwell told her to have sex with former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson; former Democratic Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell; the late MIT computer scientist Marvin Minsky; and MC2 model agency cofounder Jean Luc Brunel."

**[EFTA02731420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731420.pdf) -- Victim's Personal Journal/Scrapbook:**

> "I am so confused by everything and people you expect to be good like even old senators like George Mitchell who you think would be good like a grandpa are bad."

This document is marked "CONFIDENTIAL FOR ATTORNEY'S EYES ONLY -- DO NOT COPY" and appears to be a victim's personal writings/scrapbook that also references:
- Leon Black ("that fat fuck bit me! He threw me on the floor and blood all over Jeffreys carpet")
- Dan Snyder ("Joe Gibbs is so nice but Dan Snyder is a pig!")
- Larry Summers ("Both he and Larry Summers are fucking disgusting!")
- Mr. Leonsis, Mr. Case, Mr. Kimsey, Mr. Colgan, and others

### 8.3 No Financial Records Found

Unlike David J. Mitchell, George Mitchell does not appear in the Deutsche Bank wire transfer records ([EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf)). No direct financial transactions between Epstein and George Mitchell were found in the databases searched. George Mitchell has [publicly denied the allegations](https://www.pressherald.com/2019/08/09/former-u-s-sen-george-mitchell-denies-allegations-made-by-epstein-victim/).

### 8.4 George Mitchell -- No Connection to David Mitchell

There is no documentary evidence in these files connecting George Mitchell (senator) to David J. Mitchell (Mitchell Holdings LLC). They appear to be unrelated individuals who share a surname.

## PART X: MITCHELL HOLDINGS LLC -- ADDITIONAL ASSOCIATES

### 10.1 Doug Arnaudin

**[EFTA02097931](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02097931.pdf):** Lists "Doug Arnaudin" alongside "David Mitchell" -- likely a business associate or employee at Mitchell Holdings LLC.

### 10.2 "Sasha"

**[EFTA02271386](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02271386.pdf):** Mitchell tells Epstein "Will have Sasha set up by tomorrow" re the YIVO introduction. "Sasha" appears to be an assistant or associate.

### 10.3 Stephen Henson / Stephen Hanson

Two individuals with similar names appear in the November 2017 documents:
- **Stephen Henson** ([EFTA02571038](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02571038.pdf)): Construction-related, told Epstein "Not quitting. There is not proper funding. David will actually need to show up."
- **Stephen Hanson** ([EFTA02571059](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02571059.pdf)): The restaurateur/operator at the Life Hotel restaurant. These may be the same person with OCR errors in the name, or two separate individuals.

---

## PART XI: PROSECUTORIAL ASSESSMENT

### 11.1 Mitchell's Functional Role

Based on the complete documentary record, David J. Mitchell served Epstein in **five distinct capacities:**

1. **Real Estate Proxy/Nominee:** Using Epstein's proof of funds letters to make purchases, managing properties, and interfacing with sellers, contractors, and lenders on Epstein's behalf.

2. **Investment Scout:** Identifying acquisition targets (51% deals, California real estate), conducting due diligence, negotiating prices, and proposing LLC structures.

3. **Property Development Manager:** Day-to-day management of the Life Hotel project including construction oversight, contractor coordination, escrow management, and regulatory compliance (TCO).

4. **Financial Intermediary:** Receiving substantial wire transfers ($580,500 documented) from Epstein's Deutsche Bank accounts, with the instruction to "make money" and "clear that cascade will authorize the payments."

5. **Estate Executor:** Named co-executor of Epstein's 2014 will, placing him in a position of ultimate fiduciary authority over Epstein's multi-hundred-million-dollar estate.

### 11.2 Potential Criminal Exposure

The following patterns raise prosecutorial concerns:

1. **Nominee/Proxy Transactions:** Using proof of funds letters from Epstein to purchase property in Mitchell's name or through Mitchell Holdings LLC may constitute **undisclosed beneficial ownership** violations.

2. **Wire Transfer Fragmentation:** The March-April 2019 pattern of fragmenting payments ($25K + $14K + $4K on a single day; subsequent payments of $5,500, $3,000, $7,800, $2,200) could reflect itemized vendor payments or could raise questions about structuring. No structuring charges were filed, and the individual payments do not consistently fall below standard reporting thresholds.

3. **The Cascade Directive:** Epstein's instruction to "clear that cascade will authorize the payments" may evidence **unauthorized payment authorization** or circumvention of fiduciary controls on restricted funds.

4. **Knowledge of Source of Funds:** As co-executor and close business associate, Mitchell would have had awareness of Epstein's financial activities. If funds flowing through Mitchell's accounts were proceeds of illegal activity, this could create potential exposure under financial transaction statutes, though no such charges were filed.

5. **Concealment of Beneficial Ownership:** The question "do you have another idea for who can hold the [...]" suggests systematic use of nominees and holding structures to obscure true ownership.

### 11.3 Unanswered Questions

1. What entity is "Cascade"? Is it a legal entity, a bank process, a code name, or an escrow mechanism? **(Remains open.** DS9/DS11 search found no additional "Cascade" references as an Epstein entity or code name beyond the single [EFTA02570991](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02570991.pdf) document. The word appears only in unrelated contexts -- dishwasher detergent, a workplace violence training document, and one NTOC tip using the word in its ordinary English sense. This reinforces that "Cascade" was an informal/private reference.**)**
2. ~~What was the purpose of the September 2011 "Peter Mandelsohn" coordination between Mitchell and Todd Boehly?~~ **RESOLVED:** Mitchell proposed "bringing Peter into the Irish situation" -- a specific business proposal involving Mandelson's European/Irish expertise and Boehly's business interests. Epstein served as the convener.
3. ~~Is "Jamie Mitchell" related to David J. Mitchell?~~ **RESOLVED:** Jamie Mitchell is David Mitchell's wife. They jointly own a landmarked home. Jamie worked as a broker on Mitchell's Epstein-funded projects.
4. ~~What was the 82nd Street property, and who were the investors Mitchell was writing to?~~ **RESOLVED:** 320 East 82nd Street ("The Park Mansion"), operated through Park Partners Manager LLC (Mitchell) with FT Real Estate, Inc. (Epstein/Indyke) as the capital partner.
5. Did Mitchell actually serve as executor after Epstein's death, and what access did he have to estate funds? **(Partially resolved:** DS9 shows the "1953 Trust" (August 8, 2019) demoted Mitchell from primary trustee to fifth in the successor trustee line. Primary trustees became Indyke and Kahn only. Mitchell also appears in the loan forgiveness section ([EFTA00099303](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00099303.pdf)).**)**
6. What was the Vicis entity in the 51% acquisition negotiation?
7. What is the relationship between NLR Resorts International LLC (which received $100,000 in Dec 2017 - Jan 2018) and Mitchell's operations?

The nature of any advisory relationship between Global Counsel and Epstein entities remains unclear from these documents but is strongly suggested by the [EFTA01744877](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01744877.pdf) fragment: "Mandelson has joined the ad[visory]..."
