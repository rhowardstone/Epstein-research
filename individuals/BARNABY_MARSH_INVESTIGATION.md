# Barnaby Marsh: The Templeton Foundation Executive at the Center of Epstein's Science Philanthropy Network

## Executive Summary

Barnaby Marsh — a Rhodes Scholar with a D.Phil. in Zoology from Oxford, and Executive Vice President of the John Templeton Foundation — appears in 2,831 distinct documents across the EFTA production, making him one of the most frequently mentioned non-staff, non-lawyer individuals in the entire corpus. The documents span a decade of continuous contact, from May 2009 through June 21, 2019 — fifteen days before Jeffrey Epstein's arrest.

The corpus reveals that Marsh was not a casual social acquaintance. He occupied a structural position at the intersection of institutional philanthropy and Epstein's private funding operation. In his capacity at the Templeton Foundation, Marsh managed an $11 million grant to Martin Nowak's Program for Evolutionary Dynamics (PED) at Harvard, personally restructured its disbursement to route $6 million through an external philanthropic vehicle rather than Harvard, and solicited Epstein for supplementary co-funding. Epstein's USVI-based entity, Enhanced Education, then formally proposed to "partner" with the Templeton Foundation on the same Nowak project, with a $1.5 million contribution — the proposal letter addressed directly to Marsh.

In August 2019, two days before his death, Epstein named Marsh as the second-in-line successor trustee of his estate — ahead of his own attorneys.

No criminal charges have been filed against Marsh. No trafficking allegations exist in any public source.

## The Position

Marsh's title at the John Templeton Foundation, as stated on the formal correspondence in the corpus, was **Executive Vice President, Strategic Initiatives, and Managing Director, Philanthropic Leadership Network** ([EFTA00306058](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00306058.pdf)). The foundation is headquartered in West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania. His institutional email was bmarsh@templeton.org.

Marsh held a D.Phil. in Zoology from Oxford, where he studied decision-making under conditions of risk and uncertainty as a Rhodes Scholar. Before Oxford, he attended Harvard (freshman year) and Cornell (A.B. 1996 in Economics, Psychology, and International Affairs). He was also listed as affiliated with the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, on the advisory board of Nautilus magazine.

## The Funding Pipeline

### The $11 Million Templeton Grant (May 2009)

The most structurally significant document in the corpus is a May 12, 2009 email exchange between Marsh and Epstein regarding Martin Nowak's Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard.

Marsh wrote to Epstein:

> "About Martin, these are the details: his rent and the associated overhead that Harvard takes is about $400k per year, or $2m over 5 years (this is absolute minimum to keep him there and operating); his additional amounts for scholarship/scholars outside of the Templeton grant is about twice that amount; his current running budget is $1.2M per year (or $6M over 5 years). When we made the $11M grant, we though that this would scale up and expand his exceptional center and work, so if we could somehow raise $6M to add our $11M to that would be ideal. That is what I think we should aim for." ([EFTA02442393](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02442393.pdf))

In the same thread, Marsh described his plan for restructuring the grant's disbursement:

> "I'm going to put $6M of our grant in an external philanthropic vehicle (either a DAF or simply an external account; with will save the project $600k in overhead) and put about $5M through Harvard. but nonetheless his center needs to be viable. As before, we can pick up the costs of administration but he needs a real solution for the rent, which we can't fund because of charter restrictions. If we can't do that he has to close PED. There is no other option."

Marsh then asked Epstein directly for money:

> "Would you be in a position to make any additional contributions at all? Does anyone come to mind who Martin might approach (and who we might talk to first?)."

Two features of this correspondence are notable. First, Marsh uses the phrase "our grant" — treating the Templeton Foundation grant as a joint venture with Epstein rather than a unilateral institutional award. Second, a senior officer of the Templeton Foundation is soliciting a registered sex offender for supplementary funding while simultaneously restructuring millions in foundation grants to route them outside Harvard.

Marsh added that he planned to seek further Templeton resources: "I'm going to be asking Templeton to approve an additional $2M supplement for broad philosophical/applied questions after year 2 of the project, so this will further amplify the importance of Martin's work, which can not be understated — he is a genius."

### The Enhanced Education Partnership (November–December 2015)

Six years after the initial grant discussion, the co-funding arrangement was formalized. A letter dated December 2, 2015, from **Enhanced Education** — Epstein's USVI-based entity at 6100 Red Hook Quarter, Suite B-3, St. Thomas — was addressed to Marsh at the Templeton Foundation. The letter was signed by **Darren Indyke, Vice President** of Enhanced Education.

The letter stated:

> "Martin Nowak has been sharing with Enhanced Education his proposed new research applications of evolutionary game theory to the behavioral sciences. As you know, Enhanced Education is very interested in supporting Martin's work."

> "We understand that the John Templeton Foundation is currently considering a project proposal in which Enhanced Education would have the opportunity to partner with the John Templeton Foundation through contributions which Enhanced Education has made to Harvard University's Program for Evolutionary Dynamics and allocated to Harvard University Fund 347150, $1,500,328 [$1,304,633 direct costs + $195,695 indirect costs] of which contributions have been budgeted for this project."

> "In 2003 Enhanced Education established a gift to the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics to support precisely this type of cutting edge research."

([EFTA00306058](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00306058.pdf); copies at [EFTA00314149](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00314149.pdf), [EFTA00584873](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00584873.pdf), [EFTA00602286](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00602286.pdf))

The letter was drafted by Indyke and sent to Epstein for approval before being forwarded to Marsh. The cover email read: "Attached is the proposed letter to John Templeton Foundation which I have revised to state what I think was intended. Please let me know if the revised letter is acceptable and if so, I will send to Barnaby Marsh." ([EFTA00333696](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00333696.pdf))

The urgency of this arrangement is documented in a November 24, 2015 email from Martin Nowak to Epstein: "did you have a chance to have the letter sent to barnaby. very informal is fine. they need it very soon for the next award." Christopher Stawski of the Templeton Foundation added: "We're hoping to distribute the proposal to our Trustees tomorrow, so we do need the letter ASAP." ([EFTA00680165](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00680165.pdf))

### Coordinating Institutional and Private Funding

On November 23, 2014, Epstein emailed Marsh: "can we talk about your funding for joi and martin so that our mutual involvement gets the best result" ([EFTA02596274](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02596274.pdf)). The "joi" is Joi Ito, then-director of the MIT Media Lab; "martin" is Martin Nowak.

On July 10, 2015, in an email thread with Joi Ito, Epstein wrote: "or over the weekend Ill be in caribbean talking to barnaby, anything you want me to champion." Ito replied: "We are still sorting out the grant." ([EFTA00851720](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00851720.pdf))

The pipeline also extended to MIT hiring decisions. On October 30, 2013, Joi Ito emailed Epstein about hiring Joscha Bach at the MIT Media Lab: "From MIT's perspective, Joscha should be at about $60K/yr. He wants $100K." Ito then asked: "Also, did Barnaby get back to you about whether we can fund this via Templeton?" Epstein replied: "the money part is easy, ill ask bamaby have not heard." The thread concluded with Ito writing: "OK, so I'll process him at 60K at MIT and tell him that you'll work with him on the spread." ([EFTA00632203](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00632203.pdf), [EFTA00632206](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00632206.pdf))

### The Templeton Application Pipeline

The pipeline ran in both directions. Academics who wanted Templeton money went to Epstein, who went to Marsh.

On June 11, 2015, Epstein forwarded to Marsh a message from Larry Summers' wife: "from larry summers wife, my program officer is Sarah Clement — sclement@templeton.org —. I've never met her. the person I have met and who coached me in the application is John Seel — Is there any way to check on the progress of her request?" ([EFTA02500377](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02500377.pdf))

On October 4, 2015, Epstein followed up: "any news on larry summers wife grant from templeton?" Marsh replied: "no idea — I'm not connected with that but could find out.... last I heard it was going in a good direction..." ([EFTA00698783](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00698783.pdf))

The academic in question, Elisa New (Powell M. Cabot Professor of American Literature at Harvard), was explicit about the pipeline in a direct email to Epstein: "Had I gotten the Templeton grant I'd have hired 2-2½ more people... which is why I'd like to ask Templeton/Barnaby to reconsider the planning grant of 249K now." ([EFTA00844477](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00844477.pdf))

## The Science Network

### The Inner Circle

Marsh was a full participant in Epstein's science salon. The scheduling documents show him attending regular early-morning breakfasts at Epstein's 71st Street residence — typically at 7:00 or 7:30 AM — and joining multi-party meetings with scientists across the entire 2009–2018 period.

On September 23, 2011, Cecile de Jongh (who worked at Epstein's Financial Trust Company) organized a "Minsky Conference" with nine invitees: Marvin Minsky, Lawrence Krauss, George Church, Martin Nowak, Sean Parker, Lee Smolin, Steve Sinofsky, Jim Watson, and Barnaby Marsh ([EFTA01855058](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01855058.pdf)).

### Travel Companion

Marsh flew on Epstein's private aircraft to Cambridge, Massachusetts, for days of meetings at MIT and Harvard. A schedule from April 1, 2016, documents the itinerary:

> "8:00am Barnaby to be picked up by Carsco and taken to Teterboro"
> "9:00am Depart NY, Barnaby Marsh lofty w/JE"
> "9:30am Arrive Bedford, Jet Aviation"

The day's appointments at the MIT Media Lab included Seth Lloyd, Martin Nowak, Joe Jacobson (at Nicholas Negroponte's request), Jeremy Rubin, and Joi Ito. The day concluded with dinner with Larry Summers in Brookline, Massachusetts. ([EFTA02054827](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02054827.pdf))

On another trip, April 29, 2016, Epstein's assistant wrote to Martin Nowak: "Jeffrey should be to your office tomorrow around 10am or so... he is bringing Barnaby Marsh with him."

### Introducing Scientists to Epstein

Marsh actively recruited scientists to meet Epstein. In December 2016, Marsh wrote to Epstein: "was with Watson today, and he really wants to meet you but he had a full schedule — asked for dates... when are you here?" He added: "also, separately, Helen Fisher wanted to meet again, if interested" ([EFTA02666708](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02666708.pdf)).

In September 2014, Marsh wrote to Epstein about billionaire surgeon Patrick Soon-Shiong: "re: measurement and innovation, do you know Patrick Shiong? he has the kind of independent mind that might also be good on this." Epstein replied: "Yes of course" ([EFTA00626014](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00626014.pdf)).

### The Gates Connection

In September 2013, Epstein told Marsh: "I will do some funding at MIT with gates. Deception signals. want to join" ([EFTA00663554](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00663554.pdf)).

However, when Epstein proposed Marsh as a dinner guest for Bill Gates in February 2013, Gates' science advisor Boris Nikolic pushed back:

> "I would stay away of Barnaby — I know that you are liking him but Templeton Foundation has a bad reputation of religious mambo jumbo wrapped up with pseudo science."

Epstein replied: "your call, but bamaby is not like that at all. he went to oxford, only hikes real science. the princpals are wackos"

Nikolic responded: "I understand — he might do a mistake of joining Tempelton. Because of its prinicipals, that foundation has a horrible reputation. Not bad but a number of scientists are actively lobbing against. I heard it from so many people/leading scientists. Bill is one of the least religious people you will ever meet."

([EFTA00668371](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00668371.pdf))

## The Trust

On August 8, 2019 — two days before Epstein's death — the "1953 Trust" was executed. Article VI, Section 6.1 specifies the successor trustee line:

> "BORIS NIKOLIC shall be appointed to fill any such vacancy, and if he is unwilling or unable to serve, BARNABY MARSH shall be appointed to fill any such vacancy. If BARNABY MARSH is unwilling or unable to serve, then ANTHONY BARRETT shall be appointed to fill such vacancy. If ANTHONY BARRETT is unwilling or unable to serve, then KATHY REUMMLER shall be appointed to fill such vacancy."

The full succession: Boris Nikolic → **Barnaby Marsh** → Anthony Barrett → Kathy Ruemmler → David Mitchell → Steve Hanson → Eva Dubin.

Marsh was placed ahead of Epstein's own attorneys (Ruemmler), his financial advisors (Mitchell, Hanson), and the wife of a close associate (Dubin). The estate was valued at approximately $577 million.

## Duration of Contact

The Skype conversation logs extracted from Epstein's devices document the final phase of the relationship. The logs show calls and messages between "jeevacation" (Epstein) and "barnaby.marsh" from late 2017 through June 2019. Selected entries:

- **January 29, 2018**: Marsh messages Epstein: "just curious — any AI meetings this week — Joi, Reid, etc? AI seems to be taking off... will find time to come by"
- **March 17, 2019**: Epstein messages Marsh from Palm Beach: "im in palm beach where are you." A 41-minute call follows.
- **May 31, 2019**: An incoming call from Marsh lasting 1 hour and 21 minutes — the longest documented call between them.
- **June 21, 2019**: Marsh: "free?" A 23-minute call follows. This is the last documented contact — fifteen days before Epstein's arrest on July 6, 2019.

([EFTA01617279](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01617279.pdf))

The email corpus covers an earlier period: 2009 through late 2018. The documented relationship spans at minimum ten years of continuous contact.

## What Remains Unknown

1. **What did Marsh know about Epstein's crimes?** The entire documented relationship post-dates Epstein's 2008 guilty plea and sex offender registration. There is no evidence in the corpus that Marsh knew of or participated in any criminal activity. There is also no evidence that he didn't. The documents show only the philanthropic and intellectual dimensions of the relationship.

2. **Did the Templeton Foundation conduct an internal review?** Whether the foundation investigated the Marsh-Epstein relationship after Epstein's arrest and death in 2019 is not documented in the corpus and has not been publicly disclosed.

3. **Were other Templeton grants influenced by Epstein?** The corpus documents influence on grants to Nowak (PED), a proposed channel for Joscha Bach's salary, and Epstein checking on Lisa New's application. Whether additional Templeton grants were affected cannot be determined from these records.

4. **Did Marsh know he was named successor trustee?** The trust was executed on August 8, 2019. Whether Marsh was informed of his inclusion before Epstein's death on August 10, 2019, is unknown.

5. **Was the "external philanthropic vehicle" ever established?** Marsh's May 2009 plan to route $6 million of the Templeton grant through a DAF or external account rather than Harvard — and whether this was implemented — cannot be confirmed from the email correspondence alone.

## Methodological Notes

- All EFTA citations were verified against the `full_text_corpus.db` database. Dataset assignments were confirmed via SQL query.
- Quoted passages are drawn from OCR-processed text. Where OCR artifacts are obvious (e.g., "$6M" rendered as "56M" in one instance, or `=` characters from quoted-printable encoding), corrections are made silently when the intended text is unambiguous from context. The OCR reads "56M" on page 1 of EFTA02442393, but the same email on page 0 contains the arithmetic: $11M total, $5M through Harvard, remainder external — confirming the figure is $6M. Original OCR text is preserved in the database and can be verified at `epstein-data.com/full_text_corpus/pages?efta_number=EFTA...`.
- The document count of 2,831 was obtained by searching for pages containing "Barnaby Marsh" or "barnaby.marsh" and counting distinct EFTA numbers. Many of these are scheduling emails, calendar entries, and device forensic extractions that mention Marsh in passing. The substantive documents — those containing original correspondence with operational content — number approximately two to three dozen and are cited individually above.
- Barnaby Marsh's professional biography is drawn from publicly available sources including his firm websites, his book publisher (Penguin Random House), and the Rhodes Scholars archive.
- Elisa New is identified as Larry Summers' wife based on her email to Epstein (EFTA00844477), in which she signs as "Powell M. Cabot Professor of American Literature, Harvard University," and Epstein's forwarding of her Templeton application to Marsh with the note "from larry summers wife."
- No criminal charges have been filed against Barnaby Marsh. No trafficking allegations exist in any public source. This report documents only the philanthropic and professional relationship as recorded in the email correspondence.
