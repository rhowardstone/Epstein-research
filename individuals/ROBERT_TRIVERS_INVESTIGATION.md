# Robert Trivers: The Funded Evolutionist

## Executive Summary

Robert Trivers — one of the most influential evolutionary biologists since Darwin, developer of reciprocal altruism theory, Crafoord Prize laureate — maintained a deep financial and intellectual dependency on Jeffrey Epstein from at least 2009 through March 2019, four months before Epstein's arrest. The relationship went far beyond typical philanthropy: Epstein was Trivers' self-described "major funder," actively directed which research topics Trivers could pursue, offered six-figure donations to universities as job placement leverage, and processed payments through a chain of shell entities (C.O.U.Q. Foundation → Enhanced Education Foundation → HBRK Associates). The corpus contains 943+ documents spanning a decade of correspondence that reveals a brilliant but financially desperate scientist increasingly dependent on a convicted sex offender's patronage.

In 2023 — four years after Epstein's death — the FBI FinCEN Liaison Officer sent an "URGENT - Deconfliction request" naming Trivers alongside Nautilus Inc and Sotheby's, indicating that Suspicious Activity Reports had been filed in connection with Epstein-related financial flows. This is unreported by any media outlet.

**Key unreported findings:**
- FBI FinCEN deconfliction naming Trivers (2023)
- Chapman University expelled Trivers for drunkenly exposing himself to a staff member; he blamed the firing on Chapman discovering Epstein's identity
- Funding pipeline: Enhanced Education Foundation → HBRK Associates (Richard Kahn) → Trivers
- Epstein actively controlled Trivers' research direction, blocking honor killings research and steering him toward transgender biology
- Trivers confessed suicidal/homicidal ideation to Epstein, who responded by offering to fly him to Palm Beach
- Trivers introduced Norman Finkelstein to Epstein, noting both had "experience with lock-up"

**Previously reported (Feb 2026):** The "bevy of beauties" lunch email, the transgender research steering, and approximate funding levels were covered by Yahoo News, Nature, and the Chronicle of Higher Education following the EFTA release. Trivers' defense of Epstein and offensive comments about victims were reported by Reuters in 2015. The full scope of the financial pipeline, the Chapman incident, the FinCEN investigation, and the depth of intellectual dependency documented below have not been reported.

## Robert Trivers: Background

Robert Ludlow Trivers (born February 19, 1943, Washington, D.C.) is an American evolutionary biologist whose five landmark papers in the 1970s reshaped the field: reciprocal altruism (1971), parental investment and sexual selection (1972), facultative sex ratio determination (1973), parent-offspring conflict (1974), and the evolution of self-deception. Cited in Time magazine's [special issue on the 100 greatest thinkers and scientists of the 20th century](https://www.edge.org/memberbio/robert_trivers) and called "the preeminent living evolutionist of our times" by the [Los Angeles Review of Books](https://lareviewofbooks.org/), Trivers won the [Crafoord Prize in Biosciences](https://www.crafoordprize.se/news/the-crafoord-prize-in-biosciences-2007/) in 2007 — biology's equivalent of the Nobel — worth $500,000.

Trivers' biography is itself extraordinary. The son of a U.S. State Department diplomat involved in post-war German denazification, he studied history at Harvard before switching to biology, earning his PhD in 1972 under the influence of Ernst Mayr and William Drury (formally advised by Ernest Williams). He was a member of the [Black Panther Party](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/201601/trivers-pursuit) and drove a getaway car for Huey Newton. Diagnosed with bipolar disorder, he was hospitalized multiple times. He spent years living in Jamaica, where he was known as the "Lizard Man," married twice to Jamaican women, was stabbed through the hand with an ice pick, stabbed a burglar in the neck in self-defense, and joined the Homosexual Defense League to protect gay men from mob violence. He accumulated [multiple arrests](https://darwinianbusiness.com/2016/05/15/a-wild-life-a-review-of-robert-trivers-autobiography/) and survived robberies at knife, machete, and gunpoint.

His academic career was equally turbulent. After faculty positions at Harvard (1973-1978) and UC Santa Cruz (1978-1994), he joined Rutgers in 1994. In [2012, the Chronicle of Higher Education reported](https://www.chronicle.com/article/prominent-scholar-was-banned-from-rutgers-campus/) he was banned from campus for five months after a drunken confrontation with a colleague over a disputed Nature paper. In [2014, he was suspended](https://www.chronicle.com/article/rutgers-u-suspends-noted-anthropologist/) for refusing to teach a class he said was outside his expertise. By 2015, he departed under a buyout requiring a nondisclosure agreement.

It was during this period of institutional exile — brilliant but unemployable, broke, bipolar, and aging — that Epstein's financial support became not just welcome but existential. In a 2010 funding proposal, Trivers revealed the depth of his desperation: he had been "ineligible for whatever reasons to receive federal support of any sort and have been for over 30 years" ([EFTA00761771](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00761771.pdf)). His Biosocial Research Foundation, set up in 1992, had been funded mainly by [Gordon Getty](https://gruterinstitute.org/advisory-board/), and the $500K Crafoord Prize money had run out.

## The Financial Pipeline

### Year-by-Year Funding

Trivers himself itemized the financial relationship in a remarkable email to Epstein on March 14, 2019 — four months before Epstein's arrest:

> "i have recently revised the facts: 2011 25 grand COUG / 2013-2017 between 20 and 30 grand a year ELF / with the exception of 2016 when it was 40,000 because you slapped a 10,000 'late fee' on yourself for forgetting to send 30 grand, as promised early in January"
>
> — [EFTA01030350](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01030350.pdf)

| Year | Amount | Entity | Source |
|------|--------|--------|--------|
| 2010 | $25,000 | C.O.U.Q. Foundation | [BuzzFeed News (2019)](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/jeffrey-epstein-science-donations-apologies-statements), IRS 990 filing |
| 2011 | $25,000 | C.O.U.Q. Foundation | EFTA01030350 (Trivers' own accounting) |
| 2013 | ~$20-30,000 | Enhanced Education ("ELF") | EFTA01030350 |
| 2014 | ~$20-30,000 | Enhanced Education ("ELF") | EFTA01030350 |
| 2015 | $30,000 | Enhanced Education ("ELF") | EFTA02502553, EFTA00860559 |
| 2016 | $40,000 | Enhanced Education ("ELF") | EFTA01030350 (includes $10K "late fee") |
| 2017 | ~$20-30,000 | Enhanced Education ("ELF") | EFTA01030350 |
| **Total** | **~$175,000-$225,000** | | |

### The Entities

**C.O.U.Q. Foundation** — Epstein's philanthropic vehicle (EIN 13-3996471), with Epstein as president. Made [$46 million in transfers to Les Wexner's YLK Charitable Trust](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/11/epstein-donated-46-million-to-les-wexners-private-foundation-in-2008.html) in 2008, plus donations to Harvard, Stanford, Ohio State, and the Ramaz School. [IRS 990 filings available on Scribd](https://www.scribd.com/document/410656394/The-C-O-U-Q-Foundation-2008-990-Jeffrey-Epstein). The foundation shut down circa 2012.

In January 2012, Trivers emailed Epstein asking for the foundation's address: "can you give me an address with zip for your Foundation that kindly gave me $25,000 in 2010? i only have it listed as COUG Foundation in NYC. the IRS on my 990 PF is asking for the exact address." ([EFTA02548850](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02548850.pdf))

**Enhanced Education Foundation** ("ELF") — The successor vehicle after C.O.U.Q. shut down. Linked to the [J. Epstein VI Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein_VI_Foundation), which also funded Lawrence Krauss's Origins Project at ASU ($250,000, 2010-2017) and George Church's work at Harvard. Made the now-broken $30 million pledge to Harvard's Program for Evolutionary Dynamics (only $6.5M delivered).

### The HBRK Pipeline

The funding didn't flow directly from Epstein to Trivers. In May 2015, Trivers asked Epstein for the promised $20,000 for a sprinting research project in Jamaica. Epstein replied "yes of course" — and **cc'd Richard Kahn at HBRK Associates** to process the payment:

> "i wonder if i can ask your Enhanced Education Foundation to send along the promised 20...i am eager to 'buy' a set of data...reaction times, speed to 20m, and brute strength."
>
> — [EFTA02502553](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02502553.pdf)

Kahn followed up multiple times asking for wire details ([EFTA02718307](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02718307.pdf), [EFTA00635824](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00635824.pdf)). This confirms the funding conduit: **Epstein → Enhanced Education Foundation → HBRK Associates → Trivers' Biosocial Research Foundation**. HBRK Associates was the operational hub managing Epstein's finances — see our [HBRK/Emad Hanna investigation](../individuals/EMAD_HANNA_HBRK_INVESTIGATION.md) documenting how HBRK managed $84.5M across 39+ entities.

### "I Am His Major Funder"

Epstein was explicit about the relationship's nature. In an email exchange with Noam Chomsky on October 20, 2015:

> **Chomsky:** "Hah. One for Bob Trivers."
> **Epstein:** "i am his major funder [OCR: 'binder']. he got thrown out of rutgers for good this time."
> **Chomsky:** "Good choice. He's a great scientist and fine guy. Thrown out of Rutgers? I didn't hear anything about that. Was just down there for talks."
>
> — [EFTA00714274](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00714274.pdf)

The exchange arose from a joke about reciprocal altruism — Epstein helping with Chomsky's wife's medical care.

### The $100,000 University Donation Offer

Beyond direct payments, Epstein offered Trivers a standing $100,000 donation to any university that would hire him — with $80,000 earmarked for a research fund under Trivers' control:

> "you called me once when i was waiting outside a CUNY building waiting for an interview for a possible job—when you heard that, you said, if it comes up and would be useful tell them you have a friend who will donate 100 grand to them, 80 to be put in a research fund under my control"
>
> — [EFTA01030350](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01030350.pdf)

This offer was deployed as leverage at CUNY, Oklahoma State, and Chapman University before the Chapman "debacle" retired it.

### The Brockman Intermediary

The initial connection ran through John Brockman's Edge Foundation. In November 2009, Brockman wrote Epstein a confidential note about Trivers:

> "He needs some support for research, i.e. a budget to hire people to help with his book, etc. but he's embarrassed to ask you. I told him to write up a proposal and send it to you which he'll do or not do."
>
> — [EFTA00768588](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00768588.pdf)

Within months, Epstein committed the initial $25,000: "i am starting you off with 25k" ([EFTA00747390](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00747390.pdf)). That money funded research that went into Trivers' 2011 book *The Folly of Fools: The Logic of Deceit and Self-Deception in Human Life*. Before publication, Trivers wrote to ask "the name of your foundation, or how you wish to be referred to, for the acknowledgements of my self-deception book—i thank several foundations and would like to thank yours" ([EFTA00677165](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00677165.pdf)). The C.O.U.Q. Foundation was duly acknowledged. His 2015 memoir *Wild Life* went further — Trivers "thanked your Foundation but also you" personally ([EFTA02475456](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02475456.pdf)).

### The Bank Records

The financial trail is documented not just in emails but in actual banking records. A J.P. Morgan bank statement for The COUQ Foundation Inc. from April 2010 shows a $50,000 deposit from Enhanced Education, followed by a $25,000 debit to Bay Federal Credit Union, Scotts Valley, CA — the account for Trivers' Biosocial Research Foundation ([EFTA01500963](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01500963.pdf)).

The 2013 funding chain is documented step by step: Trivers requests $20,000, specifying "NO make it out to my own Foundation, as before: Biosocial Research Foundation" and explaining Rutgers "takes 5% off the top." Epstein forwards to Richard Kahn at HBRK. Kahn asks "please advise on amount you would like to send from enhanced." Epstein replies: "20k." ([EFTA00968905](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00968905.pdf), [EFTA00969082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00969082.pdf), [EFTA00969084](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00969084.pdf))

By 2017, the process was routine. Kahn confirmed: "25k from enhanced as we have done in the past. I will have Darren draft agreement. Ok for check to go out today before agreement returned." Epstein: "Yes." ([EFTA01037144](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01037144.pdf)) — Darren Indyke drafted the grant agreements, and checks went out before paperwork was returned.

## Research Direction: Epstein as Patron-Controller

Epstein did not merely fund Trivers' existing work — he actively directed which research topics he would support. The clearest evidence comes from a March 2019 exchange, when Trivers asked why funding had stopped:

> **Trivers:** "after 7 years of continuous support, you seemed to flip, no support at all for past two years nor response to requests"
>
> **Epstein:** "I thought that you might want to focus on transgender biology. people would be interested and i would fund. I am a true believer in your talents. my understanding and of course it could be incorrect was that honor killing work was detrimental for you... giving you money for subjects that would be in my strong view detrimental to your future creates a problem."
>
> — [EFTA01035762](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01035762.pdf)

Trivers largely agreed: "i certainly agree on the interest side—and therefore the commercial side—far better LGBTQ than Honour killing—the latter i will complete in my spare time on behalf of the victims" ([EFTA02637714](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02637714.pdf)). He accepted the funding pivot but insisted he'd continue the honor killings work unpaid. This was five months before Epstein's arrest.

The pattern was consistent. In August 2017, Trivers reported solving "the problem of honour killings in both Islamic and Hindu settings." Epstein engaged substantively, replying with his own theory: "if you kill your daughter you dont have to pay a dowery to another familiy, reducing the tribes wealth" ([EFTA02638980](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02638980.pdf)). But by 2019, Epstein had decided this line of research was commercially unviable and cut off funding until Trivers agreed to pivot.

Epstein also deployed Trivers' theories as intellectual currency. To Martin Nowak in 2009: "many of the codes are to DECEIVE the other side...dna would have developed deceiving codes to fool viruses. THIS is the key, deception in the code...ala trivers" ([EFTA01817760](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01817760.pdf)). To Steve Bannon, Epstein used Nobel laureate friends as social draws; Trivers served the same function for other scientists, as documented below.

### The Trans Email

On December 17, 2018 — seven months before Epstein's arrest — Trivers sent Epstein a detailed email on transgender biology, subject line "Trans":

> "with greater molecular control over development we are increasingly capable of producing novel phenotypes... BTW we are now pushing the intervention earlier--so you notice your 3-year old son has trans tendencies, so now you intervene with hormones—i would be frightened to do that—but who knows?"
>
> — [EFTA01013384](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01013384.pdf)

The email discusses pediatric hormone intervention, transgender prostitution economics, and comparative phenotypic outcomes — written in Trivers' characteristically blunt scientific voice, sent to a man convicted of soliciting sex from minors. This email connects to Epstein's [documented interest in eugenics and human biological manipulation](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/business/jeffrey-epstein-eugenics.html).

### Published Research Acknowledging Epstein

Trivers' published papers explicitly thanked Epstein's foundations. His 2014 paper in *Human Biology*, "2D:4D and Running Speed in Jamaicans" (with colleagues), includes: "We thank the Coug Foundation and the Biosocial Research Foundation for their support" ([EFTA02397274](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02397274.pdf)). In 2014, Trivers offered Epstein a personal acknowledgment in a paper submitted to *Science*: "please note that you are thanked personally in the sprinting paper; if you prefer not to be, just say so and only your Foundation will be thanked" ([EFTA00661817](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00661817.pdf)). A 2017 paper on self-deception (von Hippel & Trivers) also acknowledged Enhanced Learning Foundation ([EFTA00645854](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00645854.pdf)).

In April 2015, Trivers sent Epstein a list of 8 published papers produced since his Rutgers suspension in January 2014, crediting Epstein's support: "with your 30 and another 12 i was later to scratch out of my own life, i kept up a very busy and productive session of research" ([EFTA02506164](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02506164.pdf)). Epstein's immediate reply: "what is your strategy moving forward. would you like me to fund something" ([EFTA00860559](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00860559.pdf)).

## The Social Dimension: Lunches at 9 East 71st Street

Trivers was a regular visitor to Epstein's Manhattan townhouse for lunches that served as intellectual salons — and, as Trivers himself noted, featured "always a woman or two present, 25+."

### Calendar Evidence

The corpus contains numerous calendar entries documenting Trivers' visits:

- **Dec 4, 2013:** "12:30pm Lunch w/Robert Trivers" — same day as Josh Harris (10am), Josh Ramo (11am), Ehud Barak (3pm) ([EFTA00284747](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00284747.pdf))
- **Dec 4, 2014:** "12:30pm Lunch w/Bob Trivers. JOJO TO TAKE BOB TO PENN STATION AFTER LUNCH AT 2PM" — same day as Kathy Ruemmler and Greg Poe at 2pm ([EFTA00284900](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00284900.pdf))
- **Jan 11, 2017:** "10:30am Bob Trivers stopped by" — same day as breakfast with Leon Black at 8:45am ([EFTA00285348](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00285348.pdf))
- **Jan 28, 2012:** Lunch with Trivers, Richard Axel (Nobel laureate), Karyna Shuliak, and Joe Pagano ([EFTA00304795](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00304795.pdf))

### Trivers as Social Draw

Epstein used Trivers as intellectual bait to attract other scientists:

> "Jeffrey will be hosting Robert Trivers for lunch today at 12:30...he is asking if you might like to join in on the lunch"
> — Lesley Groff to Joshua Cooper Ramo, Dec 4, 2013 ([EFTA02119669](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02119669.pdf))

> "Jeffrey will be hosting a lunch on Sat. Jan. 28th at noon...Robert Trivers will be coming and Jeffrey believes you will find him quite interesting."
> — Invitation to Richard Axel ([EFTA02175857](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02175857.pdf))

> "richard, robert trivers, is bright crazy funny, I thought you might enjoy him."
> — Epstein introducing Trivers to Richard Axel, Jan 26, 2012 ([EFTA00420918](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00420918.pdf))

### The "Bevy of Beauties" and "Always a Woman or Two"

Trivers was candid about the social atmosphere. After a January 2012 lunch, he wrote: "that was a wonderful lunch, a REAL pleasure; many thanks indeed quite apart from the bevy of beauties and the prickly Nobel Prize winner who could only say that his work concerned 'smell'" — referring to Richard Axel. ([Previously reported by Yahoo News, Feb 2026](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/ex-rutgers-professor-jeffrey-epstein-185600621.html))

In his March 2019 accounting email, Trivers described the ritual: "pleasant lunch with a glass of wine for me though you do not drink, always a woman or two present, 25+, and your driver taking me straight to Penn Station" ([EFTA01030350](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01030350.pdf)).

### Palm Beach and Virgin Islands Visits

The relationship extended beyond Manhattan:

- **Mar 16, 2010:** "Robert Trivers lands into Ft. Lauderdale at 2:30pm. I would estimate his arrival at the house sometime around 4:15/4:30pm since he will need to go through customs." ([EFTA01826703](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01826703.pdf)) — Trivers flying from Jamaica.
- **Nov 18, 2009:** Epstein to Trivers: "hey, we sent you the details of your flight at least twice, are you set?" ([EFTA01819970](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01819970.pdf)) — Epstein booking Trivers' travel.
- **Jan 21, 2010:** Trivers to Epstein: "i fly down to palm beach friday...hopefully spend from about 2 to 9 with, including some kind of food" ([EFTA01823764](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01823764.pdf))
- **Sep 30, 2016:** Trivers: "always free to visit VI" ([EFTA00638889](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00638889.pdf)) — standing invitation to the Virgin Islands.
- **Dec 28, 2017:** Palm Beach meeting where Trivers described as "one of the most pleasant with anyone ever—i asked you why you liked white women, when you asked me about black, and we both laughed" ([EFTA01030350](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01030350.pdf))

### Edge Foundation Dinners

Trivers appeared at John Brockman's Edge Foundation events alongside Epstein:

- **Feb 16, 2011:** Le Cirque dinner — guest list included Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, Trivers, Freeman Dyson, Eric Kandel, Daniel Kahneman, Jean Pigozzi, Dimitar Sasselov, Lee Smolin, Richard Thaler, Naomi Wolf ([EFTA01799443](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01799443.pdf))
- **"Origins of Deception" dinner:** Trivers alongside Lee Smolin, Richard Thaler, Dimitar Sasselov, Naomi Wolf, David Shipley, plus Jeff Bezos, Sergey Brin, Anne Wojcicki, Sean Parker ([EFTA02040138](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02040138.pdf))

Trivers was categorized in Epstein's contacts as "John Brockman's friend Trivers Robert" ([EFTA02119588](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02119588.pdf)) — the Brockman pipeline label used by Epstein's staff. Yet privately, Trivers mocked the Edge operation: "without the egomaniacal nonsense that infects John Brockman—the key is to get the brightest minds in a room and have them tell each other what they think is most important—or some such nonsense. neither David nor i can think of a single scientific advance achieved that way" ([EFTA00853720](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00853720.pdf)).

### The Deception Symposium on Little St. James

In January 2014, emails document a "Symposium on Deception on LSJ" — a formal academic event on Epstein's private island — scheduled for February 22-23, involving Sebastian Seung and Neil Gershenfeld ([EFTA00499736](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00499736.pdf)). Self-deception was Trivers' signature late-career theory. A symposium on his field, held on the island of a convicted sex offender, captures the grotesque intersection of Epstein's intellectual pretensions with the reality of what Little St. James was.

---

## The Chapman Debacle

### Timeline

In August 2017, Trivers reported to Epstein that Chapman University in Los Angeles was "interested in a relationship with me and will pay me $10,000 each for two five-day visits" ([EFTA02638724](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02638724.pdf)). The university's president was "most eager to make contact" with Epstein — presumably in connection with the standing $100,000 donation offer.

By March 31, 2018, something had gone catastrophically wrong. Trivers emailed Epstein a two-word verdict: "fuck Chapman" ([EFTA02487959](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02487959.pdf)).

### The Confession

Two weeks later, Trivers laid out the full story to Epstein, building to a rhetorical punchline:

> "barred from all campuses at once and for life or subject to immediate arrest for 'trespassing'—barred from employment for life as well—contract terminated within 3 days—and for what?—drunkenly flashing my 75-year-old dick to a staff member ON MY PROPERTY"
>
> — [EFTA02475524](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02475524.pdf)

Then Trivers drew a direct connection between his firing and Epstein's identity:

> "very likely that sudden turn against me by Chapman is associated with discovery of who you are...extraordinary coincidence that we are both accused of sex crimes...i am going to fuck them up, trust me, on both our accounts"

He also noted the $100,000 offer "has now done its work...so it can now be retired" — confirming it had been deployed as leverage at multiple institutions.

### Current Status at Chapman

Chapman University's faculty page for Trivers has since been [removed](https://www.chapman.edu/our-faculty/robert-trivers) (returns 404 as of February 2026). [Nature reported](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00554-4) that palaeontologist John "Jack" Horner, another Epstein-linked scientist, was fired from Chapman after the EFTA release. Whether Trivers was similarly let go is unknown.

## The Dershowitz-PED Conflict

The Trivers-Dershowitz feud provides a window into how Epstein's funding created institutional leverage at Harvard.

In May 2007, Trivers was scheduled to give a talk at Harvard's **Program for Evolutionary Dynamics (PED)**, established with Epstein's $6.5 million donation and directed by Martin Nowak. About an hour before the event, Nowak cancelled it. Trivers had previously called Dershowitz — who served as both Epstein's defense attorney and a PED faculty affiliate — a "Nazi-like apologist" over the Lebanon War. Trivers suspected Dershowitz or Epstein was responsible for the cancellation.

The [New York Post covered the incident](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01682184.pdf) ("BLAME GAME," June 21, 2007): "DID legal eagle Alan Dershowitz and alleged pervy billionaire Jeffrey Epstein use their clout to get a speech canceled at Harvard?" The [Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2008/2/13/trivers-visit-to-reignite-feud-robert/) reported Trivers' return in February 2008, when he [derided Dershowitz during the rescheduled talk](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2008/2/15/in-speech-trivers-derides-dershowitz-robert/).

Despite the public feuding over PED, Trivers and Epstein remained close. By 2012, Epstein was still directing PED activities, emailing Nowak: "we should meet again with trivers" and instructing Nowak to invite specific scholars to PED ([EFTA01843130](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01843130.pdf)).

---

## The David Haig Connection

In March 2018, Trivers formally introduced Epstein to **David Haig**, the George Putnam Professor of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at [Harvard](https://www.oeb.harvard.edu/people/david-haig). Haig is a leading expert on genomic imprinting and parent-offspring conflict — work that builds directly on Trivers' foundational theories.

> "meanwhile, David has heard plenty about you Jeffrey, a financial/mathematical mind of exceptional quality and you should know that David is one of the very top evolutionary geneticists still breathing and my teacher on every detail large and small"
>
> — [EFTA00853720](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00853720.pdf)

But the introduction wasn't new. Trivers later revealed the connection dated back to 2004: "David Haig at Harvard whom you met at a party you threw for me at Martin's way back in 2004" ([EFTA02638724](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02638724.pdf)) — "Martin's" being Martin Nowak's, placing the initial Haig-Epstein meeting at Harvard PED. Haig also appeared in Edge Foundation guest lists forwarded to Epstein ([EFTA02198780](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02198780.pdf)).

**To be clear:** There is no evidence in the corpus that Haig received funding from Epstein or any Epstein-affiliated entity. Haig appears exclusively as a social and intellectual contact — CC'd on Trivers' group emails alongside Gordon Getty and Norman Finkelstein ([EFTA00977156](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00977156.pdf), [EFTA00834985](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00834985.pdf)), cited by Trivers as an intellectual reference, and present at Edge Foundation events. The connection is social introduction, not financial dependency.

No media outlet has reported on the Haig-Epstein connection. The [epsteinweb.org tracker](https://epsteinweb.org/david-haig/) lists Haig at one degree of separation with "Weak" connection strength.

---

## Mental Health and the Epstein Safety Net

The correspondence reveals Trivers' mental health crises and Epstein's response to them.

### The Suicidal/Homicidal Confession

On July 31, 2016, Trivers wrote to Epstein:

> "was VERY low for a couple of weeks in Jamaica -- suicidal, that is to say, homicidal, making a rank-ordered list of whom i would kill first; couldn't imagine anyone on your list besides perhaps a lawyer"
>
> — [EFTA00630136](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00630136.pdf)

Epstein's response: "sorry to hear about your lows...what time on monday will you be in florida. if you fly to palm beach early we can spend some time. I can organize your ticket if you are ok with that."

Three months later, in October 2015, Trivers suffered a mild heart attack: "your joke about us creeping along in years when we should be sure to enjoy ourselves took on special meaning two days ago when i was admitted to the local Robert Wood Johnson hospital with a mild heart attack" ([EFTA00844304](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00844304.pdf)).

Epstein was aware of Trivers' bipolar disorder, his physical decline, and his financial desperation. When Epstein later cut off funding (2017-2018), Trivers' dependency was laid bare.

### The Rutgers NDA

In July 2015, Trivers told Epstein he was "waiting in New Jersey for Rutgers to cough up the first check due me on what i am no longer allowed to talk about—given the so-called non-disclosure form i signed—so i didn't write this and you didn't get it" ([EFTA00852190](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00852190.pdf)). He planned to leave Rutgers and New Jersey "for good" by January 2016.

### The Desperate Job Search

After Rutgers, Trivers cycled through academic appointments, each time measuring the opportunity against Epstein's support:

- **CUNY** (Aug 2016): "underwhelming...75% chance of a one course spring semester, 4 months maximum pay $20,000—that barely supports life in the city" ([EFTA00822148](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00822148.pdf))
- **Hunter College** (Mar 2019): "$5500/semester—my God, Jeffrey, rent is 8 grand" ([EFTA01035762](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01035762.pdf))
- **Oklahoma State, U of Kentucky, UC Riverside** (Aug 2016): "not sure i want to live in Stillwater Oklahoma...none of these people promoting me either know me or are very strong" ([EFTA00822148](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00822148.pdf))
- **Chapman University** (2017-2018): Expelled after the flashing incident
- **U Texas Austin** (Oct 2018): one-line message to Epstein ([EFTA01019701](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01019701.pdf))

At every stage, Trivers reported back to Epstein like a client to a patron.

---

## The Norman Finkelstein Introduction

In December 2017, during a Palm Beach visit, Trivers introduced the controversial political scientist Norman Finkelstein to Epstein. The email is remarkable for its self-awareness:

> "i briefly characterised you and said you had out of the blue responded strongly to his name and asked if i could put him in touch with you (I did tell him that like myself you had more experience than he had with lock-up)"
>
> — [EFTA02554350](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02554350.pdf)

Trivers acknowledged Finkelstein was facing criminal charges (harassment/stalking) at the time. The "experience with lock-up" comment — casually referencing both his own arrests and Epstein's sex trafficking conviction — captures the moral universe in which these exchanges occurred.

---

## Trivers as Epstein Defender

### "We ALL Have Similar Problems"

The most revealing document about Trivers' moral positioning is a "PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL" email to Epstein from May 2018, in which Trivers recounts discussing Epstein with Gordon Getty:

> "Gordon asked me at one point whether you were the same Jeffrey accused of relations with minors; i said 'yes' and he said, 'well, we ALL have similar kinds of problems'"
>
> — [EFTA00816165](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00816165.pdf)

In the same email, Trivers actively minimized the abuse: "i said that i thought you had acted with integrity, both in the protection the young women received from you and your woman friend whom i knew well, having met her through you several times, that most were not in fact under age of consent (17), almost always massages, you had served your time." The "woman friend" is almost certainly Ghislaine Maxwell.

### "A Bit More Than Massages"

Yet in private, Trivers acknowledged the reality was darker than his public defense. In March 2019, he told Epstein about a New York Times article: "that is a strong NY Times piece in your favour—a couple of minor errors—it was not prison but county jail and it was a bit more than massages" ([EFTA01030917](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01030917.pdf)). The gap between "almost always massages" (to Getty) and "a bit more than massages" (to Epstein) captures the self-deception of a man who literally wrote the book on the subject.

The same email reveals real-world consequences: Trivers' public defense of Epstein ([reported by Reuters in 2015](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-epstein-science/once-shunned-financier-jeffrey-epstein-is-back-friends-with-a-harvard-professor-idUSKCN0RU1O220151001/) — "by the time they're 14 or 15 they're like grown women were 60 years ago, so I don't see these acts as so heinous") caused him to be interrogated by a dean and department chair at East Carolina University before being permitted to lecture. "My host at East Carolina University told me right after picking me up at the Raleigh/Durham airport that someone had seen my comments on the internet and reported them to the Department Chair and it climbed up to the Provost who insisted that i meet with the Department Chair and the Dean to be questioned before i would be permitted to lecture."

### The Title IX Email Forwarded to Krauss

In October 2018, Trivers told Epstein that a university seminar had been cancelled because "in a recent graduate student survey about Title IX issues some students reported that you made comments that made some of them uncomfortable." Epstein forwarded this email directly to Lawrence Krauss ([EFTA01019689](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01019689.pdf)) — who was himself facing sexual misconduct allegations at ASU. The forwarding was an act of solidarity among men who saw themselves as victims of what Trivers elsewhere called "the strong national trend" of men "being brought low for alleged misbehaviour toward women."

---

## Third-Party Observations

### Krauss and Epstein: "A Lit Fuse"

Behind Trivers' back, Epstein and Lawrence Krauss discussed him with clinical detachment. In May 2013, Krauss wrote to Epstein about Trivers: "he has to be handled very carefully...a lit fuse at all times I think...but he is brilliant." Epstein replied: "i am friends and a fan. he is emotionally unstable however and trouble follows. i would be happy to fly him out in august" ([EFTA00657734](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00657734.pdf), [EFTA00960695](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00960695.pdf)).

Krauss was recruiting Trivers to ASU's Origins Project — which would have brought another Epstein-funded scientist under Krauss's umbrella: "he wants to talk to me about leaving Rutgers and coming here...I was happy to win him over since he can be quite a son [of a bitch]" ([EFTA00945914](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00945914.pdf)).

### Joscha Bach's Character Analysis

In July 2017, AI researcher Joscha Bach wrote Epstein a three-page meditation on social perception that included:

> "Trivers was faced with a similar sentiment when he defended you publicly (even though it was to the tune of 'well he did wrong and served a bit of time, not as much as we mortals would have, but still, and you should forgive him now'), and Krauss (who in public Internet discussions maintained that you did nothing wrong, and took heavy flak for it)."
>
> — [EFTA02645850](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02645850.pdf)

### Barnaby Marsh's Assessment

Barnaby Marsh, who managed Epstein's science philanthropy through the Templeton Foundation pipeline (see [Barnaby Marsh investigation](../individuals/BARNABY_MARSH_INVESTIGATION.md)), offered a characteristically diplomatic assessment: "trivers is interesting but a little out there" ([EFTA02019240](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02019240.pdf)).

### Epstein Proselytizing Trivers' Work

Epstein promoted Trivers' theories to his legal and business contacts. Lawyer Matthew Menchel (Kobre & Kim) wrote to Epstein: "I've reflected a lot on our conversation regarding Trivers and what implications his research has for me and my family" ([EFTA01968056](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01968056.pdf)).

### The Huffington Post PR Operation

In August 2017, Epstein directed a Huffington Post reporter (via publicist Masha Drokova) to interview Trivers about "How has Jeffrey Epstein's donations helped you advance your research?" Epstein emailed both Drokova and Trivers: "you should contact robert trivers" ([EFTA02639205](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02639205.pdf)). This was PR management — Epstein curating his public image as a science philanthropist through a cooperative recipient.

---

## FBI FinCEN Investigation (2023)

Four years after Epstein's death, the FBI FinCEN Liaison Officer sent an urgent deconfliction request naming Trivers:

> "Here are 10 additional names provided by FinCEN to deconflict. Provide your response by COB tomorrow, 4/5/2023."
>
> Three visible names: **Nautilus Inc, Sotheby's, Trivers, Robert.**
>
> — [EFTA00144222](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00144222.pdf)

The FBI New York Field Office responded: "USAO has not been releasing information due to an appeal pending regarding Ghislaine Maxwell. However, we don't necessarily have an objection to release" ([EFTA00144234](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00144234.pdf)).

**FinCEN deconfliction means:** financial intelligence reports — Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) — were filed naming Trivers in connection with Epstein-related financial activity. The FBI was checking whether pursuing these leads would conflict with the Maxwell case or other ongoing investigations. The request was marked "URGENT" and came from the FBI's FinCEN Liaison at Criminal Investigative Division (CID), suggesting the financial trail was considered significant.

**No media outlet has reported on this FinCEN investigation.** The combination of known financial flows (C.O.U.Q. → Enhanced Education → HBRK → Biosocial Research Foundation, totaling $175K-$225K) and an active 2023 FinCEN inquiry suggests the government identified financial patterns warranting investigation beyond what is documented in the corpus.

---

## Trivers' Own Words: The Relationship Summarized

In his March 2019 accounting letter — the most personally revealing document in the corpus — Trivers summarized what Epstein meant to him:

> "when you once said, perhaps in Palm Beach, that there would never be a time when you would not support me, i joked to friends this was better than social security—tax free and you invested your money more wisely than did the US government, so they might go under but you never would"
>
> "the point to me is that i enjoy you as an organism, a very bright and far-ranging mind, with personal integrity"
>
> — [EFTA01030350](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01030350.pdf)

"Personal integrity" — written about a convicted sex offender, by a man who would later [tell Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-epstein-science/once-shunned-financier-jeffrey-epstein-is-back-friends-with-a-harvard-professor-idUSKCN0RU1O220151001/) that Epstein's victims were "like grown women" and that he didn't "see the acts as so heinous." He later acknowledged this was a "stupid and offensive statement" ([BuzzFeed News, 2019](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/jeffrey-epstein-science-donations-apologies-statements)).

The last Trivers-Epstein email in the corpus is dated April 2, 2019 — three months before arrest. Trivers sent Epstein (alongside David Haig, Gordon Getty, and his own daughter Natasha) an article titled "Everyone Knew This Arab-Israeli Woman Would Be Murdered" — an honor killing case ([EFTA01034565](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01034565.pdf)). Still pursuing the research Epstein had told him to drop. Still cc'ing Epstein on his family's emails. Still dependent.

Four months later, Epstein was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges. He was dead five months after that.
