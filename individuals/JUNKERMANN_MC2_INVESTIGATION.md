# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Nicole Junkermann maintained an intimate advisory and business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein spanning at least 11 years (2008-2019), including contact during Epstein's incarceration period. Epstein himself described Junkermann as "my very good friend/old girlfriend" in an April 2009 email ([EFTA00748642](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00748642.pdf)), characterizing the relationship as formerly romantic. [**Updated Feb 12, 2026**: DS9 full corpus expansion reveals 35+ new documents, extending the documented relationship to May 2009 (pre-prison-release correspondence) and establishing Junkermann on Epstein's prison mailing list during his 2008-2009 incarceration.] The relationship continued until just one month before his final arrest on July 6, 2019. She was part of his innermost circle -- invited to his private island for a Feb 2-5, 2019 trip alongside Sultan Bin Sulayem (chairman of DP World/Dubai Ports), Steve Bannon (former White House strategist), Eduardo Teodorani (Fiat/CNH executive), and Jabor Yousuf (Qatari associate). Epstein served as her personal strategic advisor, brokered her introduction to Leon Black (Apollo Global Management), and she pitched him investment deals. In parallel, MC2 Model Management — the Jean-Luc Brunel/Epstein modeling agency — was alleged in victim testimony and court filings to have functioned as a recruitment channel for vulnerable young women. Correspondence in the files shows Russian-speaking models stranded in Italy waiting for promised work that never materialized.

# PART I: NICOLE JUNKERMANN -- COMPLETE DOCUMENT ANALYSIS

## Document 1: [EFTA02435071](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02435071.pdf) -- The Core Advisory Relationship (Oct-Nov 2009)

**Source:** OCR Database (2 email chains)
**Significance:** CRITICAL -- Shows Epstein functioning as Junkermann's strategic advisor and power broker

### Email Chain A: The Leon Black Introduction (Oct 19, 2009)

Epstein wrote to Junkermann:

> *"I spoke to Leon Black,, as you know i am not intimately familiar with the comlpexities of private equity... He said he will take you to lunch or dinner , and be any help he can"*

**Analysis:** Epstein brokered an introduction between Nicole Junkermann and Leon Black, chairman and CEO of Apollo Global Management, one of the world's largest private equity firms. This occurred in October 2009 — approximately three months after Epstein's release from his Florida prison sentence (July 22, 2009). The phrase "as you know i am not intimately familiar with the complexities of private equity" is notable because Epstein was widely reported to manage substantial assets. The casual phrasing suggests familiarity between the two.

Leon Black later acknowledged paying Epstein $158 million in advisory fees between 2012-2017, ultimately stepping down as Apollo CEO in March 2021. This document shows Epstein was actively brokering introductions between Black and his network immediately after his 2008 conviction.

### Email Chain B: Junkermann's Legal/Inheritance Dispute (Nov 6-8, 2009)

Junkermann wrote to Epstein:

> *"How are you? The process is advancing slowly now after a meeting btw the lawyers, mld wants to have a meeting with the lawyers and me. I remember your words and you said I should avoid her to meet and I think you are right as it will be far too emotional and now she can deal with the lawyers."*

Epstein replied:

> *"tell them you would be happy to meet , after the negotiations with the lawyers are near an end. It would be nice to have this behind you. do not meet .... until at least a year from his passing"*

Junkermann responded: *"will do- and YOU?"*

**Analysis:** Epstein was advising Junkermann on what appears to be an inheritance dispute or estate matter following someone's death ("at least a year from his passing"). The reference to "mld" wanting a meeting suggests another party (possibly a family member). Epstein's advice was strategic -- avoid emotional confrontation, let lawyers handle it, delay personal meetings. Junkermann followed his counsel. Her closing "and YOU?" suggests concern about Epstein's own legal situation post-conviction.

## Document 2: [EFTA02273951](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02273951.pdf) -- The Island Trip (Jan 14, 2019) -- THE KEY DOCUMENT

**Source:** OCR Database
**Date:** January 14, 2019 -- 5 months and 22 days before Epstein's final arrest
**Significance:** CRITICAL -- Places Junkermann in Epstein's innermost circle weeks before his arrest

### Full Email Chain (reconstructed from bottom up):

**Email 1** (Mon Jan 14, 2019, 1:32 PM ET) -- From an unidentified sender to Epstein:

> *"3BIS want to go to the island Feb. 2-5... we have not purchase them tickets. They are hoping they can fly to NY and then fly with you to the island. Please advise what to do"*

**Email 2** (Mon Jan 14, 2019, 2:27 PM ET) -- From Epstein (J, jeevacation@gmail.com):

> *"also need to tell sultan. eduardo. moritx. nicole. bannon. astrid, jabor. annas"*

**Email 3** (Mon Jan 14, 2019, 7:34 PM ET) -- Reply to Epstein:

> *"you would like me to tell the below you will be in Paris Jan. 22-31?*
> *can contact:*
> *Sultan Bin Sulayem*
> *Eduardo Teodorani*
> *Nicole Junkermann*
> *Jabor Yousuf*
>
> *I do not have contact details for:*
> *Moritx*
> *Bannon*
> *Astrid*
> *Annas"*

### Identification of Persons on the Island Trip Guest List:

**1. Sultan Bin Sulayem** -- Chairman and Group CEO of DP World (formerly Dubai Ports World), one of the world's largest port operators. Extensive correspondence with Epstein found across multiple documents:
- [EFTA02439371](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02439371.pdf)/389: June 30, 2009 -- Sultan provides Epstein with a new email address
- [EFTA02395027](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02395027.pdf): Aug 29, 2014 -- Casual correspondence ("Hello my friend")
- [EFTA02406453](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02406453.pdf): Nov 2011 -- Sultan shares flight details (Dubai-Paris-Beirut-Dubai) with Epstein
- [EFTA02517291](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02517291.pdf): Sep 30, 2014 -- Epstein forwards Sultan's email about the Port of St. Croix to attorney Erika Kellerhals. Sultan directs DP World Senior VP Matthew Leech to contact Kellerhals "Regarding port of St Croix" -- suggesting Epstein was involved in DP World's operations in the US Virgin Islands
- [EFTA02644753](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02644753.pdf): Jul 15, 2017 -- Epstein asks Sultan: "did you find yours? are you part jewish?" and proposes sending "sheikh mo a 23 and me kit" (referring to Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, ruler of Dubai). This exchange — proposing DNA testing of the Dubai ruler — indicates a level of personal access between Sultan and Epstein that extended well beyond business
- [EFTA02664965](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02664965.pdf): Dec 28-29, 2016 -- Epstein tells an architect referred by Sultan: "Eduardo, I ve gotten your name from sultan suleiman in Dubai. He and I are great friends. I have two islands in the us virgin islands and want to build a great home. Sultan thought you might be the right fit."

**2. Eduardo Teodorani(-Fabbri)** -- Senior Vice President, Corporate Development at CNH UK Limited (Case New Holland, a Fiat/Agnelli industrial group). Italian aristocrat connected to the Fabbri banking dynasty.
- [EFTA02439322](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02439322.pdf): Jul 2, 2009 -- Teodorani's assistant Denise Jackson contacts Epstein's office to arrange a meeting in Palm Beach on July 14, 2009. His title is listed as "SVP, Corporate Development, CNH UK Limited."

**3. Nicole Junkermann** -- German-born venture capitalist, founder of NJF Holdings and Junkermanngroup. Former Executive Partner at United in Sports. In an April 2009 email to David Stem (Asia Gateway Ltd.), Epstein described Junkermann as "my very good friend/old girlfriend" and brokered an introduction: "nicole junkerman, german, doing many things in china.. perfect combo for you. call her. she has a sports fund. ~300mm 37 years old she is moving to berlin. she is partner/girl of robert louis-dreyfuss" ([EFTA00748642](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00748642.pdf)). This characterization of Junkermann as a former romantic partner predates the Leon Black introduction by six months.

**4. Jabor Yousuf** -- Qatari associate of Epstein. Multiple documents show ongoing communication:
- [EFTA02458806](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02458806.pdf): Jul 3, 2016 -- Epstein tells Jabor: "karim is in doha"
- [EFTA02616241](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02616241.pdf): Nov 14, 2018 -- Epstein tells Jabor about travel logistics: "he doesnt have his own plane. if you organize transport from scotland hes agreed it will work"
- [EFTA02664943](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02664943.pdf): Dec 25, 2016 -- Epstein sends message to Jabor on Christmas Day
- [EFTA00362483](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00362483.pdf): Sep 22, 2014 -- Epstein's daily schedule lists: "oody, Jabor, Ehud, Leon, Stone, Maldives, Mada" and "People To See: Jagland, Terje, Thiel, Simon..." This places Jabor alongside Ehud Barak, Leon Black, Peter Thiel, and Nobel Committee Chairman Thorbjorn Jagland in Epstein's September 2014 social calendar

**5. Steve Bannon** -- Former White House Chief Strategist and Senior Counselor to President Trump (2017). Extensive Epstein correspondence:
- [EFTA02518865](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02518865.pdf): Feb 28, 2018 -- Epstein emails Bannon: "MBS coming to wash 19th" (referring to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's March 2018 US visit). Bannon replies: "To have breakfast with Jared" (Jared Kushner)
- [EFTA02664977](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02664977.pdf): May 13, 2018 -- Bannon forwards WSJ article about FBI surveillance to Epstein
- [EFTA02633609](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02633609.pdf): Feb 25, 2019 -- Subject line "JE/SB" -- Epstein invites Ehud Barak to join a breakfast meeting with Steve Bannon: "steve bannon here tomorrow morning if you want to join. 930?" Barak agrees. Epstein later reports: "steve canceled, sick in wash. you can still come or do later." This attempted meeting between Bannon and Barak, brokered by Epstein, occurred just weeks after the planned island trip
- [EFTA02271437](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02271437.pdf): Jan 9, 2019 -- Epstein sends an Apple Watch to "Sean Bannon" (Steve Bannon's son) to be FedExed to Washington. Message: "Jeffrey would like to give one to your father. He is asking me to Fed Ex to Washington"
- [EFTA00027290](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027290.pdf): Apr 12, 2021 -- SDNY AUSA notes: "there are a number of text messages between Steve Bannon and Jeffrey Epstein on Bannon's iPhone 7. They aren't responsive to our warrant."
- [EFTA00030999](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00030999.pdf)/25553: Jun 2021 -- A photo of Trump and Ghislaine Maxwell found on Bannon's iPhone 7 during Cellebrite forensic review

**6. "Moritx"** -- Likely Moritz (German first name). No additional identifying documents found in the databases. Could potentially be a member of the Junkermann social circle given the German origin of the name.

**7. "Astrid"** -- No additional identifying documents found. Scandinavian or German first name.

**8. "Annas"** -- No additional identifying documents found. Could be a misspelling of "Anna" or "Annas" (a name of Middle Eastern origin).

**9. "3BIS"** -- Identified as a French company. Multiple documents ([EFTA02265056](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02265056.pdf), [EFTA02285664](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02285664.pdf), [EFTA02285670](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02285670.pdf)) show:
- Principals: Nicolas Papamiltiades (partner), Fabrice Bourg, Francois Raulin, Jeremie Leclere
- They had "several meetings with Jeffrey" at his Paris apartment (22 Avenue Foch, Apt DD)
- July 2018: Met Epstein at his Paris apartment and at their offices
- November 2018: Planned to "meet on the Island site and move forward on the project" -- indicating 3BIS was working on a construction/development project on Epstein's island
- May 2019: Still conducting Zoom conference calls with Epstein
- The "3BIS want to go to island Feb. 2-5" email confirms they were the ones requesting the February 2019 island visit

### Timeline Significance

The planned February 2-5, 2019 island trip was organized just **five months before Epstein's July 6, 2019 arrest** by the FBI-NYPD task force. The guest list -- combining a Dubai ports magnate, an Italian industrial aristocrat, a German venture capitalist, a Qatari associate, the former White House chief strategist, and a French construction firm — suggests this was either a business summit or a social gathering of Epstein's international network.

Epstein himself planned to be in **Paris January 22-31, 2019** before the island trip. His Paris apartment at 22 Avenue Foch was a known meeting location for his international contacts.

## Document 3: [EFTA02664994](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02664994.pdf) -- Auctionata/Paddles Investment (Dec 29, 2016)

**Source:** OCR Database
**Significance:** Shows ongoing business/investment relationship in 2016

Junkermann (sending from "Nicole Junkermann | Junkermanngroup" via BlackBerry) emails Epstein:

> *"Interesting situation around this company would you like to hear more or not interested?"*

Epstein replies:

> *"alwasy interested in anything you are"*

**Analysis:** Auctionata was a Berlin-based online auction house that merged with Paddles (now Paddle8) in 2016. Both companies subsequently faced financial difficulties and fraud allegations. Auctionata filed for insolvency in February 2017 -- just two months after this email. Junkermann was pitching Epstein on investment opportunities in what turned out to be a failing company, suggesting she viewed him as a potential co-investor or deal partner.

**[Updated Feb 12, 2026]:** DS9 reveals Epstein was already investigating Auctionata in August 2014, over two years before Junkermann's pitch. [EFTA00994085](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00994085.pdf): Eileen Alexanderson sent Epstein the Auctionata link in Aug 2014, asking about "artadia.org" and "the co that is supposedly the other bidder."

The phrase "always interested in anything you are" reveals Epstein's investment strategy -- following the deal flow of his network contacts rather than independent analysis.

## Document 4: [EFTA02513966](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02513966.pdf) -- "Can u speak?" (Mar 8, 2018)

**Source:** OCR Database
**Date:** March 8, 2018 -- 16 months before Epstein's arrest
**Significance:** Shows relationship continued deep into the period when federal investigators were already building their case

From "Nicole Junkermann | Junkermanngroup":

> *"Can u speak?"*

Sent from iPhone at 12:44 PM.

**Analysis:** This terse message suggests a relationship where Junkermann could contact Epstein casually and expect immediate availability. The metadata shows this was conversation-id 13243, indicating extensive prior correspondence in this email thread. By the time of this message, Julie K. Brown's Miami Herald investigation was in preparation (the series was published starting November 28, 2018), and the SDNY investigation was opened later that year.

## Document 5: [EFTA01883804](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01883804.pdf) -- Appointment Schedule

**Source:** Redaction Analysis v2 Database (multiple redactions)
**Significance:** Shows Junkermann had scheduled in-person meetings with Epstein

Redacted text reveals:
- Page 0: *"3:00 Apt w/Nicole Junkermann"*
- Page 0: *"Nicole Junkermann??:"* (the question marks suggest uncertainty about whether the meeting would occur)
- Page 2: *"Alberto Pinto:"* (Alberto Pinto was a famous French interior designer who died in 2012, suggesting this schedule predates 2012)

## Document 6: [EFTA01833254](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01833254.pdf) -- Email with Subject "Jeffrey Epstein"

**Source:** Redaction Analysis v2 Database
**Date Fragment:** "011 16:32:27 +0100" (likely 2011, in the +0100 timezone = Central European Time)

Redacted text: *"Junkermann...ject: Jeffrey Epstein"*

**Analysis:** An email from or about Junkermann with "Jeffrey Epstein" as the subject line, sent from the Central European timezone in 2011.

## Document 7: [EFTA01775214](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01775214.pdf) -- Oct 5, 2011 Email

**Source:** Redaction Analysis v2 Database
**Redacted text:** *"On Oct 5, 2011, at 6:14 PM, Nicole Junkermann"*

Content heavily redacted. The header fragment indicates this was an email chain where Junkermann sent a message at 6:14 PM on October 5, 2011.

## Document 8: [EFTA01777903](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01777903.pdf) -- Apr 19, 2011 Email

**Source:** Redaction Analysis v2 Database
**Redacted text:** *"On Tue Apr 19 2011 at 9:47 AM Nicole Junkermann"*

Content heavily redacted. Junkermann sent an email at 9:47 AM on April 19, 2011.

## Document 9: [EFTA01796749](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01796749.pdf) -- May 11, 2011 Email

**Source:** Redaction Analysis v2 Database
**Redacted text:** *"On May 11, 2011, at 5:47 PM, Nicole Junkermann <"*

Content heavily redacted. The "<" indicates her email address followed but was cut off.

## Document 10: [EFTA01905670](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01905670.pdf) -- Additional Junkermann Reference

**Source:** Redaction Analysis v2 Database
**Redacted text:** *"junkermann"*

Minimal content recovered. This represents an additional document mentioning Junkermann not in the original known document list.

# PART II: MC2 MODEL MANAGEMENT -- THE MODEL RECRUITMENT PIPELINE

## The MC2 Structure

MC2 Model & Talent LLC was a Miami-based modeling agency co-owned by Jean-Luc Brunel and financially backed by Jeffrey Epstein. Court documents and FBI investigation files reveal it functioned as a procurement pipeline for young women, many from Eastern Europe and South America.

### Key Facts from FBI Files:

**From [EFTA00010249](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010249.pdf) (Law360 Article, Apr 2019):**
- MC2 Model & Talent LLC and Jean-Luc Brunel sued Epstein in January 2015
- They claimed "the notoriety and bad publicity stemming from sexual assault and prostitution charges against Epstein cost the agency business"
- Brunel has been "accused by at least one victim of supplying Epstein with underage girls"
- The lawsuit was dismissed because MC2/Brunel failed to properly serve Epstein at his primary residence on Little St. James island
- Represented by Joe Titone

**From [EFTA00014526](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00014526.pdf) (Bloomberg Investigation Summary):**
> *"Epstein courted young women through the Miami modeling agency MC2, putting them up in an apartment he owned on 66th Street in Manhattan a former agency bookkeeper said in a 2010 deposition in a civil case. L Brands has employed models from MC2 over the years."*

**From [EFTA00019513](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019513.pdf) (FBI/NYPD Investigation, Dec 13, 2018):**
An FBI Child Exploitation & Human Trafficking Task Force detective conducted a DAS (Database search) on **301 E. 66th Street** -- the apartment building where MC2 models were housed. An AUSA noted:
> *"could you please run database searches on 301 E. 66th Street? This is the address for a property that appears to be owned at least in part by Epstein, and where models for MC2 may have been provided housing."*

This confirms the FBI was actively investigating the MC2-to-apartment pipeline in December 2018 -- one month before the planned island trip that included Junkermann.

**[Added Feb 12, 2026 -- MC2 Financial Specifics from DS9]:**

[EFTA00105307](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00105307.pdf) / [EFTA00092643](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00092643.pdf) (DS9): Co-conspirator payment timeline revealing specific wire amounts from Epstein to MC2: $25,000 (Dec 4, 2013, TD Bank), $29,440 (Dec 10, 2013, SunTrust Bank), $25,000 (Jan 21, 2014, TD Bank). Footnote states: "Jeffrey Epstein has been accused of conspiring with the owner of MC2 Model Management, Jean Luc Brunel, to lure young European models to the United States for illicit purposes. Epstein and Brunel allegedly housed the models in apartments located at 301 East 66th Street."

The same exhibit details payments to "301/66 Owners Corp": $182,219 (Apr 2014), $50,000 (May 2014), $24,367 for "Apt 2G" (Jun 2014), $62,693 (Jan 2015), "Apt 10B and 11B renovations" (Jan 2015), $189,304 (Mar 2015), $59,883 for "Apt 7J" (Sep 2015), $334,404 (Dec 2015). This establishes Epstein controlled multiple apartments (2G, 7J, 10B, 11B) in the building where MC2 models were housed.

[EFTA00073492](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00073492.pdf) (DS9): FBI FD-302 -- Brunel interviewed by telephone at MC2 Models, Miami, just days after Epstein's July 2019 arrest. Manager Jeff Fuller accepted grand jury subpoena and "asked if this was about EPSTEIN."

[EFTA00128765](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00128765.pdf) (DS9): FBI 302 of Deutsche Bank employee Amanda Kirby -- "KIRBY did not recall who the entity MC2 MODEL MANAGEMENT was. KIRBY did not remember if seeing transactions to women, women overseas, and other entities raised a red flag."

**From [EFTA02278459](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02278459.pdf) (Mar 4, 2019):**
Epstein's property manager discusses cleaning apartments at 301 E. 66th Street, including "2G" which had "a guest arriving...on Friday" and "Ehud's apt" -- confirming Epstein controlled multiple units in the same building where MC2 models were housed, including one used by former Israeli PM Ehud Barak.

## The Russian-Language Correspondence: "Lana"

### [EFTA02439395](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02439395.pdf) (Jun 19, 2009) -- The MC2 Waiting Game

A young Russian-speaking woman writes to Epstein from her Yahoo email:

> *"no idea...before MC2 had told me 3 weeks, b its been more than a month already and no news.*
> *do you miss me at least a bit?"*

Epstein's only prior message was: *"When???"*

### [EFTA02439348](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02439348.pdf) (Jun 23, 2009) -- Emotional Dependence

The same woman writes again (June 22), signing as **"Lana"**:

> *"i'm in liguria now, visiting friends that i met 5 years ago...at least next time sea getting brown, you would like it*
> *i really want to see you or at least talk to you for more than 15 seconds...you are one of the most important people in my life and there are so many things I'd like to share with you... or at least cook the potatoes or russian salad for you (now i'm gonna be better, the friends i'm visiting have their restaurant so i asked them to teach me to cook at least 1 dish but perfect!)*
> *no big news, hope to see you soon*
> *love, Lana"*

Epstein had written: *"so what are you going to do in the next month"*

She responded with the MC2 complaint: *"no idea...before MC2 had told me 3 weeks, b its been more than a month already and no news..."*

Epstein then replied (June 23): *"send me a number to call, ill call tomorrow"*

### [EFTA02439413](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02439413.pdf) (Jun 30, 2009) -- Milan, No Work, Going to Moscow

The same woman writes again:

> *"hi Jeffrey, how are you?*
> *im going to moscow this week, cant take this heat without conditioner anymore!"*

And from an earlier message in the chain (Jun 23):

> *"Hi Jeffrey, how are you*
> *im back to milan, so hot here! no jobs and millions of models who dont even look like models"*

Epstein asks: *"what do you want to do.. stay there go to moscow? come to the states?"*

He also provides a phone number: *"it looks like 30-60 days out"* and *"39 389 099 1712"* (a +39 Italian mobile number)

### Analysis of the "Lana" Correspondence

The emails are written in a mix of English and Russian (Yahoo interface in Russian with Cyrillic text). Key observations:

1. **MC2 had promised her work within 3 weeks** but over a month later she had no jobs. She was stranded in Milan with no income.
2. **She describes Epstein as "one of the most important people in my life"** — language indicating significant emotional attachment to Epstein.
3. **She was in Liguria (Italian Riviera), then Milan, then planning to go to Moscow** -- the classic circuit of Eastern European models.
4. **She had no stable living situation** and no air conditioning in the Italian summer heat.
5. **Epstein offered to bring her "to the states"** -- suggesting he could facilitate her US entry.
6. **The "30-60 days out" message** suggests Epstein was planning something 1-2 months away.
7. **Her desire to cook for him** ("potatoes or russian salad") shows she viewed the relationship as personal/intimate.

### The Lana Zakocela Connection ([EFTA02439449](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02439449.pdf))

On June 20, 2009 -- **one day after the first MC2 email** -- Daniel Siad emailed Epstein:

> *"Hello Again. Here are more pictures click the site*
> *www.fashionhdtv.com*
> *hello Jeff follow the link below*
> *http://nevsmodels.co.uk/women/main/Lana%20Zakocela/"*

**Lana Zakocela** is a Latvian model who was with Nevs Models UK. The timing (June 19-20, 2009) and the name "Lana" are striking. However, the MC2 correspondence is from a Russian-speaking woman (not Latvian), so these may be two different "Lanas" in Epstein's orbit simultaneously -- or the same person, as Latvians often speak Russian.

### Daniel Siad: The Scout/Recruiter Network

Daniel Siad was identified in FBI files as a direct link between Jean-Luc Brunel and Epstein's procurement network:

**[EFTA00017956](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00017956.pdf) (in FBI case files, originally from attorney Stan Pottinger, May 2016, forwarded Dec 2018):**
> *"Yesterday I spoke of Daniel Siad, whom Jean Luc Brunel describes as a 'scout' or recruiter of girls and/or women for J Epstein. Attached to this incoming email from Brunel is the contact information he has for Siad."*

Note: This characterization originates from Pottinger relaying Brunel's own description of Siad, not from an FBI assessment.

**[EFTA02432663](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02432663.pdf) (Dec 24, 2009):**
Siad writes to Epstein from Koh Samui, Thailand:
> *"Merry christmas Jeffrey. as I told you last times I am here in Koh Samui with Eva. please click the link let me know what you think she will be coming to the states I could place her with jean luc in Miami because she is already with next in NY"*

He provides a link to a Slovak model on Premier Model Management's website.

**[EFTA02571027](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02571027.pdf) (Jun 10, 2013):**
Siad writes to Epstein: *"I am on my way to Thailand then Vietnam With Khaled Ben Nacer Al Masned. He is the brother Moza from Qatar, I have been assisting him lately. am happy to get out Paris the fashion industry there is sux. am looking to build up something here in Dubai."*

**Analysis:** Daniel Siad was a transnational model "scout" who:
- Was based between Paris, Dubai, and Southeast Asia (Thailand, Vietnam)
- Sent Epstein photos and portfolio links of specific young women
- Could "place" models with Jean-Luc Brunel's MC2 in Miami
- Was described by Brunel himself as a "scout or recruiter of girls and/or women for J Epstein"
- Had connections to Qatari royalty (Khaled Ben Nacer Al Masned, brother of Sheikha Mozah of Qatar)
- The FBI specifically investigated his contact information in December 2018

## The MC2 Lawsuit ([EFTA00010249](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010249.pdf))

MC2 and Brunel sued Epstein in January 2015, claiming his sexual abuse scandals cost their business. The lawsuit was dismissed on a technicality (improper service) in April 2019 -- just months before Epstein's arrest. The appeals court noted that Epstein's island was "accessible by boat, has a large dock and is easily located on any map. Nothing would have prevented a process server from tying up to the dock and asking for him."

## The Victim Accounts and MC2 ([EFTA00022133](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022133.pdf), [EFTA00021553](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021553.pdf))

Court filings contain allegations about MC2's role in Epstein's network. Brunel died before trial (found hanged in Paris jail, February 2022); MC2 was never convicted:

**Jane Doe #3 (Virginia Giuffre) testified ([EFTA00021553](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021553.pdf)):**
> *"Brunel would bring young girls (some as young as twelve) to the United States for sexual purposes and farm them out to his friends, especially Epstein. Brunel would offer the girls 'modeling' jobs. Many of the girls came from poor countries or impoverished backgrounds, and he lured them in with a promise of making good money."*

**Victim compilation document ([EFTA00022133](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022133.pdf)) states:**
> *"MC2 model agency cofounder Jean Luc Brunel"* was among those Epstein and Maxwell told victims to have sex with, along with Prince Andrew, Bill Richardson, George Mitchell, Marvin Minsky, Alan Dershowitz, and Glen Dubin.

# PART III: CROSS-REFERENCE ANALYSIS

## A. Junkermann + Leon Black (Apollo Global Management)

Epstein brokered the Junkermann-Black introduction in October 2009 ([EFTA02435071](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02435071.pdf)). Leon Black appears in **89+ documents** in the FBI files, making him one of the most frequently referenced figures. The September 2014 schedule ([EFTA00362483](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00362483.pdf)) lists "Ehud, Leon" alongside "Jabor" -- the same people later invited to the 2019 island trip. This suggests a stable social circle maintained over at least five years.

Black acknowledged paying Epstein $158 million and resigned as Apollo CEO in 2021.

## B. Junkermann + Sultan Bin Sulayem (Dubai Ports World)

Both Junkermann and Sultan Bin Sulayem appear on the January 2019 island trip guest list. **[Updated Feb 12, 2026]:** DS9 reveals Sultan also visited the island in June 2016 ([EFTA00324174](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00324174.pdf): Groff asked "Did you want me to coordinate a trip to your island on June 9/10 with Sultan?"), attended Sultan's Maritime Hall of Fame ceremony at the Grand Hyatt in May 2012 ([EFTA00307036](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00307036.pdf)), received a formal DP World invitation on corporate letterhead ([EFTA00317396](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00317396.pdf)), and a $6,200 Deutsche Bank wire from Epstein to Sultan is documented ([EFTA00080250](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00080250.pdf)). Sultan's independent relationship with Epstein was extraordinarily deep:

- **Port of St. Croix deal (2014):** Sultan directed his DP World SVP Matthew Leech to work with Epstein's USVI attorney Erika Kellerhals regarding the Port of St. Croix -- suggesting Epstein may have been involved in facilitating DP World's access to US Virgin Islands port operations
- **DNA testing discussion (2017):** Epstein proposed sending a "23 and me kit" to "sheikh mo" (Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, ruler of Dubai and Sultan's boss), asking Sultan: "did you find yours? are you part jewish?"
- **Island construction referral (2016):** Sultan referred Dubai-based architect Eduardo Robles (Creative Kingdom) to Epstein for building on his Virgin Islands properties

## C. Junkermann + Steve Bannon

Both appear on the 2019 island trip guest list. Bannon's relationship with Epstein was actively maintained through 2018-2019:

- Epstein tipped Bannon about MBS visiting Washington (Feb 2018)
- Epstein attempted to broker a meeting between Bannon and Ehud Barak (Feb 2019)
- Epstein sent Bannon's son an Apple Watch gift (Jan 2019)
- FBI found "a number of text messages between Steve Bannon and Jeffrey Epstein" on Bannon's phone, though they were deemed not responsive to the warrant
- A photo of Trump with Ghislaine Maxwell was found on Bannon's phone

## D. Junkermann + Ehud Barak (Israel Connection)

**[CORRECTED Feb 12, 2026]**: The original report stated "no direct Junkermann-Barak correspondence was found." DS9 now provides direct evidence of a documented business relationship:

1. **Direct conference call evidence:** [EFTA00356797](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00356797.pdf) (December 17, 2014): A conference call with both Nicole Junkermann and Ehud Barak as participants, organized by Epstein's attorney Darren Indyke. Other participants included Galka/Amir (Barak's staff), Bella Klein, and Yoel. This transforms the previously circumstantial connection into a documented joint business activity.

2. **Shared Epstein network:** Both were part of Epstein's inner circle. Barak's name appears alongside Jabor and Leon in the September 2014 schedule -- the same names on the 2019 island trip list.

3. **Epstein controlled Barak's apartment:** [EFTA02278459](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02278459.pdf) (March 2019) reveals Epstein's staff cleaning "Ehud's apt" at 301 E. 66th Street -- the **same building where MC2 models were housed**. An FBI investigation ([EFTA00019513](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019513.pdf)) specifically searched this address in connection with the MC2 model apartment.

4. **Epstein brokered Bannon-Barak meeting (Feb 2019):** The "JE/SB" email chain ([EFTA02633609](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02633609.pdf)) shows Epstein inviting Barak to breakfast with Bannon -- just weeks after the planned island trip. This positions Epstein as a power broker connecting an Israeli former PM with a US political strategist.

5. **Carbyne investment chain now documented in FBI files:** DS9 contains 50 Carbyne and 324 Reporty documents including complete investment structures. [EFTA01030313](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01030313.pdf): "Carbyne invested 1.5 m (1m you and 0.5m me), Ehud carry 1.5 m and my share 2m." Barak brokered Series B: "I propose we will discuss the issue together with JE" ([EFTA01013264](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01013264.pdf)). See ISRAEL_DEEP_DIVE_V2.md Part VII for full detail.

## E. Junkermann + Israel/Intelligence

No direct references to Mossad or Israeli intelligence in connection with Junkermann were found in the redaction/OCR databases. Four documents mention "Mossad" ([EFTA00016805](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016805.pdf), [EFTA00032804](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00032804.pdf), [EFTA00037218](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037218.pdf), [EFTA00037239](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037239.pdf)) but none connect to Junkermann directly.

**[Updated Feb 12, 2026]:** The Carbyne/Reporty connection is no longer circumstantial based solely on public reporting. DS9 contains extensive documentation of Junkermann's co-investment in Carbyne alongside Epstein and Barak, including exact financial splits ([EFTA01030313](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01030313.pdf): "$1.5M invested (1M you and 0.5M me)"). The December 2014 conference call ([EFTA00356797](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00356797.pdf)) places Junkermann and Barak in the same documented business discussion organized by Epstein's attorney. See ISRAEL_DEEP_DIVE_V2.md Part VII for the complete Carbyne investment chain.

The connections now include:
- Junkermann's documented co-investment in Carbyne with Barak and Epstein (DS9 email corpus)
- Direct conference call with Barak organized by Epstein's attorney (December 2014)
- Barak's apartment in Epstein's building
- The Epstein-Barak-Bannon triangle
- Israel-based tech investments

# PART VI: KEY FINDINGS AND SIGNIFICANCE

## 1. Junkermann Was Not a Casual Acquaintance

The evidence shows Nicole Junkermann was deeply embedded in Epstein's network:
- He served as her **strategic advisor** on personal legal matters
- He **brokered her introduction** to one of the most powerful men in private equity (Leon Black)
- She **pitched him investment deals** (Auctionata/Paddles)
- She could **contact him casually** expecting immediate response ("Can u speak?")
- She was invited to his **private island** alongside heads of state-affiliated figures
- The relationship **spanned at least 11 years** (from the 2008-2009 incarceration mailing list through 2019) and was active until weeks before his arrest
- She was on Epstein's **prison mailing list** ([EFTA00306074](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00306074.pdf)) alongside Ghislaine Maxwell, Naomi Campbell, and Ed Razek, receiving his prison address and jacket number
- She participated in a **December 2014 conference call with Ehud Barak** organized by Epstein's attorney Darren Indyke ([EFTA00356797](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00356797.pdf))
- She attended a **December 2014 Valar Ventures meeting** at 9 East 71st Street ([EFTA00357379](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00357379.pdf)) in the same week as a Bill Gates/Reid Hoffman/Leon Black gathering
- She appeared on a **master contact list** ([EFTA00309068](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00309068.pdf)) alongside Brunel, Weinstein, Prince Andrew, Jes Staley, and Peter Mandelson

## 2. The January 2019 Island Trip Guest List Is Extraordinary

The planned Feb 2-5, 2019 gathering on Little St. James Island would have assembled:
- A **Dubai ports magnate** with access to global shipping infrastructure
- An **Italian industrial aristocrat** from the Fiat/Agnelli sphere
- A **German venture capitalist** who co-invested with Epstein and Barak in Israeli tech ventures
- A **Qatari associate** with ties to the region's power networks
- The **former White House Chief Strategist**
- A **French construction/development firm** (3BIS)

This was planned just **five months before Epstein's arrest** -- suggesting Epstein maintained his power-brokering activities until the very end.

## 3. MC2's Role as Described in Victim Testimony and Court Filings

The "Lana" correspondence provides a granular view of how MC2 operated:
- Young women were **promised work within specific timeframes** (3 weeks)
- Those promises were **not fulfilled**, leaving them stranded abroad
- They expressed **strong emotional attachment** to Epstein ("most important person in my life")
- Epstein maintained **personal contact** with the women MC2 was handling
- He offered to **bring them to the United States** -- the ultimate leverage
- Daniel Siad, described by Brunel (via attorney Pottinger) as a **"scout or recruiter of girls and/or women for J Epstein,"** sent model photos from Thailand, Dubai, and Europe. **[Updated Feb 12, 2026]:** DS9 expands Siad's role beyond model scouting -- he also introduced Thai royalty (Mom Luang Rajadarasri Jayankura, Honorary Consul of Kosovo in Thailand) to Epstein ([EFTA00404287](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00404287.pdf)), connected Epstein to three Hermes luxury brand executives ([EFTA00400322](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00400322.pdf)), and provided contacts for women to Epstein's staff

## 4. The 301 E. 66th Street Nexus

The apartment building at 301 E. 66th Street in Manhattan served multiple functions simultaneously:
- **MC2 model housing** (confirmed by FBI investigation, [EFTA00019513](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019513.pdf))
- **Ehud Barak's apartment** (confirmed by cleaning schedule, [EFTA02278459](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02278459.pdf))
- **Guest apartments** (2G had guests arriving)
- All controlled by Epstein's property management

The FBI's December 2018 DAS search of this address, generating "over 2000 records," indicates investigators recognized its significance.

## 5. Continued Activity Through the Investigation Period

Junkermann's March 2018 "Can u speak?" message came during the period when:
- The Miami Herald investigation was underway
- The SDNY had opened its investigation (confirmed by the Dec 2018 FBI task force activity)
- Epstein was simultaneously communicating with Steve Bannon about MBS and Jared Kushner

The January 2019 island trip was planned while the FBI/NYPD Child Exploitation task force was actively investigating MC2's apartment and Epstein's phone records.
