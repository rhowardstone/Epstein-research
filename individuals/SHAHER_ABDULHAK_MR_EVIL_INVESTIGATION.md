# "Mr. Evil": Shaher Abdulhak and Epstein's Gulf Lobbying Pipeline

## Executive Summary

Across 57 documents spanning 2012-2019, Jeffrey Epstein and his inner circle used the nickname "Mr. Evil" for **Shaher Abdulhak** (1938-2020), the Yemeni billionaire known as the "Sugar King." The identification is established by Epstein's own words in an April 18, 2018 iMessage to Steve Bannon: *"Terje = all that is good. Shaher + all that is evil."*

The corpus reveals that Epstein was brokering meetings between Abdulhak and Bannon to lobby on the **Yemen War Powers Act** — legislation that would have ended U.S. military support for the Saudi-led coalition bombing Yemen. Epstein also pitched Abdulhak to Secretary of State Pompeo's team as someone who could flip Yemeni factions from their Iranian sponsors. This lobbying operated through private iMessages, Skype, and Paris meetings at the Plaza Athénée, with no public disclosure.

Separately, Epstein had previously connected Abdulhak to **Lord Ken Macdonald**, the UK's former Director of Public Prosecutions, for £20,000 in legal advice regarding Abdulhak's fugitive son Farouk — wanted for the 2008 rape and murder of Norwegian student Martine Vik Magnussen in London.

While Abdulhak's name appears in recent media coverage of the Epstein files, **no outlet has connected him to the "Mr. Evil" codename or reported the War Powers lobbying pipeline through Bannon**.

## Part 1: The Identification

### Proof 1: "Shaher + All That Is Evil"

On April 18, 2018, in an iMessage exchange with Steve Bannon about upcoming meetings, Epstein wrote:

> **Reminder. Terje. = all that is good. Shaher + all that is evil**

Bannon replied: *"I've got that part"*

— [EFTA01615037](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01615037.pdf), page 4, 6:26:26 PM

"Terje" is [Terje Roed-Larsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terje_R%C3%B8d-Larsen), the Norwegian diplomat and Oslo Accords architect. "Shaher" is Shaher Abdulhak.

### Proof 2: The Wikipedia Link

Six days earlier, on March 12, 2018, Bannon asked Epstein the identity of someone he had just met:

> **Steve Bannon:** What was the guys name yesterday
>
> **Epstein:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaher_Abdulhak

— [EFTA01614978](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01614978.pdf), page 4

Over the following weeks, Epstein used both "Shaher" and "Mr. Evil" interchangeably for the same person in the same conversation thread.

### Proof 3: Same Topic, Consecutive Days

On April 18, 2018, Epstein messaged Bannon:

> **Mr evil would like to hire a firm to lobby on behlalf of war powers act**

— [EFTA01615037](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01615037.pdf), page 3, 2:26:45 PM

The next day, April 19, 2018:

> **Shaher asking again re war powers. .**

— [EFTA01615037](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01615037.pdf), page 5, 10:41:52 AM

Same person, same topic, same conversation thread, consecutive days.

### Proof 4: The Apartment

In a June 2016 email chain (subject: "Pinto"), staff wrote to Epstein about *"your old furniture stored in **mr Evils apt**."* Epstein replied: ***"yes to shaher** no to rothschild."*

— [EFTA02461197](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02461197.pdf)

Separately, Epstein had emailed Abdulhak directly in April 2016: *"i am redecoratig my paris apt., i will give you furniture if you like, my gift. i can put it in **your apt.**"*

### Proof 5: Parallel Document Copies

The same April 2016 email chain about apartment logistics exists in multiple copies across datasets. In one version, staff wrote *"May I contact directly **MR Shaher** to ask?"* In another copy of the same email, a different message reads *"Spoke to **mr evil** — he was going to call his driver today."*

— [EFTA00702821](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00702821.pdf) / [EFTA00828620](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00828620.pdf)

## Part 2: Who Was Shaher Abdulhak?

Shaher Abdulhak (1938-2020) was a Yemeni billionaire who founded Shaher Trading in 1963. He controlled oil concessions in Sudan, owned approximately 50% of Sudan's mobile telecommunications, and was the largest wholesaler in Yemen for rice, sugar, tea, and vegetable oil — earning the moniker "Sugar King."

Sultan bin Sulayem, the chairman of DP World, described him to Epstein:

> **Shaher is the richest Yemeni he owns oil concessions in Sudan as well as 50% of the mobile co in Sudan he is also the largest wholesaler in Yemen for rice sugar tea veg oil. And yes he is a strange man**

— [EFTA01986978](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01986978.pdf)

Epstein had asked Sultan about Abdulhak after a first meeting: *"I met with boreh and Abdul shaher from yemen. (little strange)"*

Abdulhak was a personal friend of Yemeni President [Ali Abdullah Saleh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Abdullah_Saleh) and was famously media-shy — he gave no interviews and no photographs of him appeared in local press. He maintained residences in London, Paris, Cairo, and Texas, and his email address in the corpus is chairman-21@hotmail.com. He addressed Epstein as "cousin brother" in their correspondence.

### The Martine Vik Magnussen Case

Abdulhak's son **Farouk Abdulhak** is the [sole suspect](https://justiceformartine.com/about-the-case/) in the March 2008 rape and murder of 23-year-old Norwegian business student Martine Vik Magnussen in London. Magnussen's body was found in a basement on Great Portland Street. Farouk had been seen leaving a nightclub with her hours before. Flight records show he left London for Cairo on March 14, 2008 — the same day — and was transported to Yemen aboard his father's private jet.

In a text message, Farouk Abdulhak described what happened as *"just a sex accident gone wrong,"* claiming he *"could barely piece together what happened"* due to cocaine use. Yemen has no extradition treaty with the UK, and Farouk has remained a fugitive for 18 years under the protection of his family.

In June 2012, Epstein connected Shaher Abdulhak to **Lord Ken Macdonald** (Baron Macdonald of River Glaven), the UK's former Director of Public Prosecutions. Lord Macdonald was paid £20,000, traveled to Paris to meet the elder Abdulhak, and subsequently flew to Yemen to attempt persuading Farouk to return to the UK. This arrangement was [reported by The Guardian and Yahoo News](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/epstein-asked-former-dpp-advise-205428940.html) in February 2026 based on the released files, though neither outlet connected it to the "Mr. Evil" codename.

## Part 3: The War Powers Lobbying Pipeline

### Context: The Yemen War

On [March 20, 2018](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/20/politics/yemen-war-powers-vote/index.html), the U.S. Senate voted 55-44 to table S.J.Res.54, the Yemen War Powers Resolution that would have ended U.S. military support for the Saudi-led coalition bombing Yemen. The resolution was sponsored by Senators Bernie Sanders and Mike Lee under the War Powers Act of 1973.

Shaher Abdulhak had direct stakes in the outcome. His friend Ali Abdullah Saleh had been [killed by Houthi forces on December 4, 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Abdullah_Saleh#Death), just three months before. As Yemen's wealthiest private citizen with interests spanning the country, any policy affecting the Saudi-led intervention touched his business empire and political alliances.

### The Lobbying Request

Less than a month after the Senate vote, on April 18, 2018, Epstein messaged Bannon:

> **Mr evil would like to hire a firm to lobby on behlalf of war powers act**

Bannon's immediate response: *"Not what I do"* — then, seconds later: *"can u connect me"*

Epstein replied: *"Call me."*

— [EFTA01615037](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01615037.pdf), pages 3-4

Hours later, Epstein sent the "Terje = all that is good. Shaher + all that is evil" characterization.

The next day, April 19, the follow-up: *"Shaher asking again re war powers."*

That evening, Epstein made the offer more explicit:

> **Do you want to give mr evil the name of a person to push the war power agenda? Or I can connect you two by email keeping in mind I will/can not vouch for or trust anything he says**

— [EFTA01615037](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01615037.pdf), page 6, 9:08:57 PM

Epstein was simultaneously warning Bannon about Abdulhak and brokering the introduction.

### Escalation: "Someone on Pompeo's Team"

The lobbying efforts continued for over a year. On May 15, 2019, the State Department [ordered the evacuation of non-emergency U.S. personnel from Iraq](https://thedefensepost.com/2019/05/15/us-orders-partial-iraq-embassy-evacuation/) amid escalating tensions with Iran. Secretary Pompeo had made a [surprise visit to Baghdad on May 7](https://fortune.com/2019/05/15/iraq-embassy-evacuation/) citing "specific threats" from Iranian activity.

That evening, in the same iMessage thread where he sent Bannon the New York Times article about the Iraq evacuation, Epstein discussed the Yemen situation:

> **let up on mexico and china. typical. - qatar worried re iran. . yemen at the heart of the trouble.**
>
> **libya in hiding with haftar. .**

Bannon responded: *"Qatar worried that their sponsor about to implode"*

Epstein corrected: *"not sponsor. partner"* — and then: *"houthi sponsor is iran."*

Later that night, at 11:30 PM, Epstein made his pitch:

> **Removing Iraq diplomats. Great move. Would dems prefer. Benghazi 2.0**
>
> **Someone on pompeo team should sit with mr evil.**
>
> **They will do a 180 on their sponsor in a heartbeat**

— [EFTA01616087](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01616087.pdf), page 5

Epstein was suggesting that if Pompeo's State Department engaged with Abdulhak, Yemeni factions aligned with Abdulhak's network could be persuaded to abandon their Iranian backing.

### The War Powers Resolution's Fate

The Yemen War Powers Resolution [passed the Senate 56-41 on December 12, 2018](https://www.npr.org/2018/12/12/676152310/senate-poised-to-vote-to-end-u-s-military-support-for-war-in-yemen), following outrage over the Khashoggi killing. The House passed its version on February 13, 2019. Trump vetoed the resolution on April 16, 2019.

Whether Abdulhak's lobbying efforts — brokered through Epstein and Bannon — had any influence on the veto or surrounding policy decisions is unknown. What the documents establish is the pipeline: a Yemeni billionaire using a convicted sex offender as an intermediary to reach the former White House Chief Strategist and, through him, the Secretary of State's team, on active U.S. foreign policy regarding a war that killed over 150,000 people.

## Part 4: The Bannon Pipeline

Epstein served as a connector between Abdulhak and multiple power brokers. The Bannon relationship is the most documented.

### The Introduction (March 2018)

On March 11, 2018, Bannon visited Epstein at his New York residence. The next day, he asked for the name of someone he had met there — Epstein sent the Shaher Abdulhak Wikipedia link.

— [EFTA01614978](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01614978.pdf), page 4

Within days, Bannon had internalized the "Mr. Evil" nickname. On March 14, when Epstein discussed Mongolia's potential as a summit site ("the boy" — Kim Jong Un), Bannon asked: *"Mr Evil??"* Epstein corrected: *"no kim Jung."*

— [EFTA01614980](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01614980.pdf), page 1

### The Gulf Contact List

On April 26, 2018, Epstein laid out Bannon's meeting options:

> **Jabor is HBJ chief, mr evil, waiting on a date from you, sultan easiest. I do not need to be in the loops.**

— [EFTA01615053](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01615053.pdf), page 0

Three Gulf power brokers, offered as a menu: Jabor Al Thani (intermediary for former Qatar PM Hamad bin Jassim), Shaher Abdulhak ("Mr. Evil"), and Sultan bin Sulayem (chairman of DP World). Epstein positioned himself as the broker who didn't need to attend.

### The Film Proposal

On December 29, 2018, Bannon described a documentary he was producing. Epstein asked:

> **Outline for film? I assumer Mr evil and the Saudi murderer. Are not talent**

Bannon replied: *"They are total talent"* and *"We film everybody."*

— [EFTA01615537](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01615537.pdf), page 5

"The Saudi murderer" — referenced in the aftermath of the [Khashoggi killing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Jamal_Khashoggi) on October 2, 2018 — appears to refer to Mohammed bin Salman (MBS). Epstein listed Abdulhak and MBS as potential documentary subjects alongside each other.

### "Love Me Some Mr. Evil"

By spring 2019, Bannon's affection for Abdulhak was open:

> **Epstein:** Mr evil sends his regards
>
> **Bannon:** Love me some mr evil

— [EFTA01615796](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01615796.pdf), page 5, April 27, 2019

---

## Part 5: The Terje Rod-Larsen Connection

Terje Roed-Larsen, the Norwegian diplomat who helped negotiate the Oslo Accords and served as president of the International Peace Institute, was the other pole of Epstein's Gulf network — the "good" to Abdulhak's "evil."

On April 5, 2018, Epstein messaged Roed-Larsen about a planned Vienna meeting on April 14-15:

> **Can you be in Vienna 14 and 15 April? Salem, Anas, Antonio and his finance guy and architect with drawings and plans will be there. Maybe we could do many thing there. Should we ask Mr Evil and company to come? Salem is a key guy in that context.**

— [EFTA01614416](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01614416.pdf), page 4

On April 15, Roed-Larsen asked: *"Is Mr Evil coming?"* Epstein replied: *"Don think so, have not heard though he was invited."*

— [EFTA01614423](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01614423.pdf), page 1

On August 28, 2018, Epstein offered: *"mr evil willing to meet you in europe, I don't need to be ther."*

— [EFTA01615283](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01615283.pdf), page 5

And on December 12, 2018, planning a Paris gathering for December 20:

> **Mr evil. Ehud hbj etc**

— [EFTA01615501](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01615501.pdf), page 5

The proposed Paris attendees: Shaher Abdulhak, Ehud Barak (former Israeli PM), and Hamad bin Jassim (former Qatar PM). These meetings — brokered by Epstein and Roed-Larsen — brought together Israeli, Qatari, and Yemeni power brokers in private settings.

---

## Part 6: The Paris Network

Abdulhak maintained a Paris apartment where Epstein stored furniture and held regular meetings. The Paris relationship is documented across multiple platforms:

**October 7, 2013** — A staff member emailed Epstein a list titled "Paris previous meetings":

> **mr evil, Eduardo, Sultan, caroline lang, Maria ("the lawyer") Marina, raphaelle**

— [EFTA01952761](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01952761.pdf)

**January 19, 2014** — Epstein emailed instructions: *"add to paris list, jabor, mr evil, jean luc"*

— [EFTA01940750](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01940750.pdf)

**April 27, 2019** — Via Skype to Paris staff: *"im meeting mr evil at plaza athenee at 630"*

— [EFTA01619940](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01619940.pdf), page 1

**May 20, 2019** — Via Skype: *"schedule today mr evil 5 at plaza"*

— [EFTA01620090](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01620090.pdf), page 0

**June 22, 2019** — Via Skype, two weeks before Epstein's arrest:

> **mr evil asked karyna whr ws the blonde girl from the other day? and then asked kayrna for her phone number!! oy**

Staff responded: *"Just ssy he's always disrespectful to everyone."* Epstein explained: *"He thought she was a prosttiue [prostitute]."* Staff: *"Omg. This is crazy."*

— [EFTA01620096](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01620096.pdf), pages 1-3

**October 16, 2012** — Karyna Shuliak, Epstein's girlfriend, texted: *"I start to worry about you, is Mr. Evil torturing you?:)"*

— [EFTA01893777](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01893777.pdf)

---

## Part 7: Who Knew the Nickname

The "Mr. Evil" moniker was not a private joke between Epstein and Bannon. At least six people used or understood it:

| Person | Relationship | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Jeffrey Epstein | Primary user | All 57 documents |
| Steve Bannon | Epstein contact | *"Love me some mr evil"* ([EFTA01615796](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01615796.pdf)) |
| Terje Roed-Larsen | Diplomat | *"Is Mr Evil coming?"* ([EFTA01614423](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01614423.pdf)) |
| Karyna Shuliak | Epstein's girlfriend | *"is Mr. Evil torturing you?"* ([EFTA01893777](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01893777.pdf)) |
| Paris-based staff | Scheduling assistant (Skype) | Scheduled meetings with "mr evil" ([EFTA01620090](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01620090.pdf)) |
| Redacted female associate | Paris social contact | *"people like mr evil stealing my shoe size!!"* ([EFTA00646833](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00646833.pdf)) |

The nickname was widespread enough to function as an operational codename — understood across Epstein's personal, diplomatic, and logistical networks.

---

## Part 8: Process of Elimination

One person, not multiple. Every "Mr. Evil" reference across all 57 documents, all datasets (DS9, DS10, DS11), all platforms (email, iMessage, Skype, Apple Notes), and all time periods (2012-2019) refers to the same individual.

The following people are **excluded** because they appear separately in the same lists as "Mr. Evil":

| Excluded | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Jabor Al Thani | *"Jabor is HBJ chief, mr evil, waiting on a date"* ([EFTA01615053](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01615053.pdf)) |
| Sultan bin Sulayem | Same list; also describes Shaher to Epstein as "a strange man" |
| Ehud Barak | *"Mr evil. Ehud hbj etc"* ([EFTA01615501](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01615501.pdf)) |
| Hamad bin Jassim (HBJ) | Listed separately multiple times |
| Terje Roed-Larsen | Explicitly contrasted: *"Terje = all that is good"* |
| Jean-Luc Brunel | *"add to paris list, jabor, mr evil, jean luc"* ([EFTA01940750](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01940750.pdf)) |
| Kim Jong Un | Bannon asked *"Mr Evil??"* — Epstein corrected: *"no kim Jung"* |
| MBS (Mohammed bin Salman) | *"Mr evil and the Saudi murderer"* — listed as two separate people |

---

## Part 10: What the Documents Do Not Establish

The corpus establishes that Epstein brokered meetings and lobbying introductions between Abdulhak and Bannon regarding the Yemen War Powers Act. It does not establish:

- Whether any lobbying firm was actually hired
- Whether anyone on Pompeo's team actually met with Abdulhak
- Whether any policy decisions were influenced by these efforts
- The specific policy outcome Abdulhak sought (the texts do not clarify whether he wanted to support or oppose the War Powers Resolution)
- Whether Abdulhak paid Epstein for these introductions

The documents also show a social relationship (furniture gifts, Paris dinners, Karyna Shuliak's familiarity with the nickname) that predated and extended beyond the geopolitical lobbying.

*This report was generated through computational analysis of the DOJ's EFTA production using Claude Code. Every quoted passage was verified against the source document in the full_text_corpus database. The "Mr. Evil" identification was derived entirely from corpus evidence — specifically Epstein's own equation of "Shaher + all that is evil" and the interchangeable use of both names for the same person in the same conversation threads.*

*This analysis relies on Claude Code running Opus 4.6, which can make mistakes.*
