### "MacGyver" / "Macgiver" (The Lawyer) → Benjamin Brafman — HIGH CONFIDENCE

A person discussed extensively in emails between Jeffrey Epstein and Kathryn Ruemmler (former Obama White House Counsel), 2015–2018. The corpus contains TWO DISTINCT uses of "MacGyver": (1) a carpenter/handyman on Little St. James, and (2) a defense attorney discussed by Epstein and Ruemmler. This entry covers the attorney.

**External consensus (Defector, American Prospect, CNN, multiple Substacks): MacGyver = Donald Trump**

Based primarily on [EFTA02664944](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02664944.pdf) (DS11, Jan 11, 2017): Ruemmler: "Not to disturb you, but I am struck by the similar mannerisms between Trump and McGyver." Defector (Nov 18, 2025) interpreted this as Ruemmler joking that Trump reminds her of the TV character MacGyver. No major outlet has questioned this identification.

**Corpus-based counter-argument: MacGyver = Benjamin Brafman (defense attorney)**

The "similar mannerisms" email COMPARES Trump to MacGyver, implying they are different people who share traits. Other emails describe MacGyver in terms that fit a defense attorney, not a politician:

- "Was asked and passed" to represent Eric Schneiderman ([EFTA02446582](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02446582.pdf)) — you "ask" a lawyer to take your case; politicians don't represent defendants
- "Macgiver loves representing misogynists — he empathizes with and relates to them" — language describing a defense attorney's practice
- "even more fitting would be macgiver defending" ([EFTA02503163](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02503163.pdf)) — legal defense context
- "Don't be too charmed/persuaded by your boy....or you will fall into trap I fell with MacGyver" ([EFTA02597845](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02597845.pdf), Jul 9, 2018) — Ruemmler personally "fell into a trap" with MacGyver
- "he is very close to being a psychopath -- he has no conscience" ([EFTA02386479](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02386479.pdf)) — Epstein agrees: "talking to macgiver, disturbs me, and that takes a lot"
- "Am I being a total bitch by not sending MacGyver a note or something? Obviously I don't wish him ill will. Jail, yes, but no paralysis." ([EFTA02600187](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02600187.pdf), Aug 2, 2018)
- "I am sending a plane to take him home" ([EFTA02599423](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02599423.pdf), Aug 3, 2018) — Epstein sends a plane for MacGyver after a medical setback, relaying his restrictions: "no booze, driving, lifting, working, seapaddling, or really anything but walking for 3 fucking months"

**The Bannon iMessage clincher** — [EFTA01615580](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01615580.pdf) (DS10, Jan 20, 2019): Epstein and Steve Bannon discuss Harvey Weinstein:
- Epstein: "Harvey Weinstein, like Donald can't find anyone to be his lawyer"
- Bannon: "Yes alex spiro and burck both have worked with **Ben** and say Harvey can't handle that he is going away for 20 years"
- Epstein: "Yes but like djt. He told **ben** how to fight it and made some horrific mistakes. instead of letting the girl that was a proven fake wait until trial. That would have damaged all, he wanted it out in the press that she was untruthful. Amateur bully"

**"Ben" = Benjamin Brafman.** Brafman had just separated from Weinstein (Jan 2019). Alex Spiro later became Weinstein's attorney. "Burck" = William Burck, another prominent defense attorney. Epstein critiques Brafman's strategy — saying Brafman told Weinstein how to fight but Weinstein was an "amateur bully" who wouldn't save the credibility attack for trial. This proves Epstein knew Brafman well enough to discuss legal strategy with Bannon by first name.

**Evidence summary for Brafman identification**:

| Evidence | Match |
|----------|-------|
| Defense attorney known to both Epstein and Ruemmler | YES — Brafman is one of NYC's most prominent defense attorneys |
| Represented Harvey Weinstein (hired Nov 2017, split Jan 2019) | YES — "MacGyver loves representing misogynists" (May 2018) |
| Was asked to represent Schneiderman (May 2018) and declined | PLAUSIBLE — conflict of interest (Schneiderman's AG office investigated Weinstein) |
| "Ben" reference in Bannon iMessage (Jan 2019) | YES — Brafman discussed by first name in Weinstein context |
| March 2018: "even more fitting would be macgiver defending" | Perfect timing — Brafman was already Weinstein's attorney |
| Ruemmler had personal relationship ("traumatized," "fell into trap") | Consistent — both were prominent in NYC legal community |
| Epstein sent a plane for MacGyver (Aug 2018) | Indicates person of stature |
| Represented DSK (2011) — DSK article in corpus | EFTA01839062 — Brafman successfully defended DSK |
| Dershowitz named Brafman as volunteer attorney in Giuffre case | YES — "Ben Brafman is one of the leading criminal lawyers... He has volunteered to help me" ([EFTA00601154](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00601154.pdf)) |
| Aleph Institute newsletter in Epstein's inbox | YES — Brafman received Champion of Hope Award ([EFTA00703171](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00703171.pdf)) |
| Brafman and "MacGyver" never co-occur in same document | YES — consistent with same person (you don't use a codename AND real name together) |
| "Similar mannerisms" to Trump | Both are brash, confident New Yorkers — comparison implies different people |

### "Mr. Big Mac" / "MBM" / "Big Mac" / "B" → Unidentified Boyfriend/Patron — UNCONFIRMED

Used by **Megane Lemiel** in emails to Epstein, Dec 2009–Jan 2010. This is the name she uses for her boyfriend/patron, from whom she was sneaking away to see Epstein.

- [EFTA01300650](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01300650.pdf) (DS10) — Jul 9, 2010: Staley to Epstein: "Maybe they're tracking u?? **That was fun. Say hi to Snow White.**"
- [EFTA01815523](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01815523.pdf) (DS10) — Jul 10, 2010: Epstein replies: "**what character would you like next**"
- [EFTA01300651](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01300651.pdf) (DS10) — Jul 10, 2010: Staley replies: "**Beauty and the Beast**"

**Significance**: "What character would you like next" implies Epstein was offering Staley a choice of women identified by Disney character names. "Snow White" was a specific individual; "Beauty and the Beast" was Staley's next "request." This exchange was produced in the JPMorgan litigation (Bates `JPM-SDNY-00000948`).

**Separately**: Epstein told a young woman (Jun 20, 2010): "brett ratner is going to film a big movie, Snow White, i would love to take photos of you in a snow white costume. you can get it from the costume store" ([EFTA01815151](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01815151.pdf), DS10) — grooming language using the Snow White reference.

**External coverage**: Widely reported. [Yahoo News](https://www.yahoo.com/news/amphtml/jeffrey-epstein-emails-former-jpmorgan-083011486.html), [Rogue Review](https://www.roguereview.net/new-docs-reveal-sick-emails-between-epstein-big-time-exec-that-was-fun-say-hi-to-snow-white-full-text/) — both published the full exchange.

### "Mr. Alien" → Woody Allen — PROBABLE

A playful nickname used in iMessage conversation, not an operational codename.

- [EFTA01619047](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01619047.pdf) (DS10) — Dec 11, 2013: "Do you know about **mr alien** playing the clarinet at the Carlyle?" Reply: "Back sat, **yes woody plays most Mondays**"

**Identification**: Woody Allen famously plays clarinet with the Eddy Davis New Orleans Jazz Band at the Carlyle Hotel on Monday evenings. The immediate "yes woody" confirmation makes the identification near-certain. Additional context: Allen played a character literally named "Mr. Alien" in Jean-Luc Godard's 1987 film *King Lear* ([IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093349/characters/nm0000095)) — likely the origin of the nickname. Documents the Epstein–Allen social connection.

### "The Apprentice" → Formal Title for Young Women in "Agreement of Favors" — CONFIRMED

**NOT a reference to Donald Trump's TV show.** "The Apprentice" is the contractual term Epstein used for young women in his standardized "Agreement of Favors" template, with himself as "the Beneficiary."

**Contract template** (dated Oct 18, 2011, used repeatedly):
> "Mr. Jeffrey Edward Epstein, jeevacation@gmail.com — Hereafter referred to as the 'Beneficiary' ... Ms. [NAME] — Hereafter referred to as the 'Apprentice' ... The Beneficiary is willing to benefit from the Apprentice's experience, skills and generosity in the framework of his amusements."

The "Apprentice" was required to provide: "fun, pleasure and assistance in relation to the various forms of amusement of the Beneficiary" and specifically: "**Presenting beautiful women.** The Apprentice will find beautiful women among her friends and acquaintances."

Epstein critiqued the first draft: "not a bad first try... there is no penalty for breach? no third party mediation in case of dispute?.. no quality assurance with standard practice... no time limit, a no complaining clause, etc" ([EFTA01741746](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01741746.pdf), DS10).

**Key documents**: [EFTA01854906](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01854906.pdf), [EFTA01852389](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01852389.pdf), [EFTA02022696](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02022696.pdf), [EFTA01983752](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01983752.pdf), [EFTA01741746](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01741746.pdf), [EFTA02722199](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02722199.pdf), [EFTA00687670](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00687670.pdf), [EFTA01125097](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01125097.pdf), [EFTA01170157](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01170157.pdf), [EFTA00922165](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00922165.pdf), [EFTA00686588](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00686588.pdf)

**At least 12–15 signed copies exist across the corpus**, suggesting multiple women were signed to this agreement. **Completely original finding — not reported anywhere.**

**Significance**: This is a formalized recruitment/procurement contract. The "Apprentice" title sanitizes a pipeline where young women were compensated for bringing other young women to Epstein. "Presenting beautiful women" is an explicit obligation.

### "Jeffery Edwards" → Jeffrey Epstein (Email Alias) — PROBABLE

An email display name used on the `jeevacation@gmail.com` address. Noticed by a childhood friend:

- [EFTA01899833](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01899833.pdf) (DS10) — Mar 15, 2013: Arty Podnos writes: "Also, **is Jeff Edwards an alias or a wrong button?**" The email CC included "Jeffery Edwards" alongside "Mark L. Epstein."

**Note**: Podnos was organizing a gathering with Mark Epstein when he noticed the discrepancy. The "Edwards" surname may relate to Epstein's middle name (Edward). **Not previously reported.**

### MARIUS ROBERT FORTELNI → Jeffrey Epstein (Austrian Passport False Identity) — CONFIRMED

A false Austrian passport bearing Epstein's photograph under the name **MARIUS ROBERT FORTELNI**, DOB 07/30/1954 (Epstein's real DOB: 01/20/1953). Seized during the 2019 search of 9 East 71st Street (item 1B76).

**Key documents** — FBI internal emails, July 14–15, 2025:
- [EFTA01656317](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656317.pdf) (DS10): "We are tracking FBI NYO seized one Austrian Passport with Epstein's photo and a different name"
- [EFTA01656330](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656330.pdf) (DS10): "The Austrian passport was in MARIUS ROBERT FORTELNI's name with Epstein's photograph" / "shows DOB 07/30/1954"
- [EFTA01656330](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656330.pdf) (DS10, p.1): "The same information for an individual known as MARIUS ROBERT FORTELNI, DOB 07/30/1954 is attributed to an Austrian Citizen in Sentinel and DIVS records"
- [EFTA01656367](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656367.pdf) (DS10): "We don't have any additional documentation to show that he traveled under a different name"

**Note**: A real person named MARIUS ROBERT FORTELNI exists in Austrian government records (FBI Sentinel/DIVS). The FBI confirmed the passport was in WFO (Washington Field Office) possession. They did not find evidence Epstein actually used it for travel. The passport seizure was previously reported but the FBI's internal 2025 scramble to document it is new from the EFTA corpus.

### "Mr. Evil" in Bannon Political Context → Unidentified Gulf Figure — UNCONFIRMED

**DISTINCT FROM** the [Shaher Abdulhak "Mr. Evil" identification](SHAHER_ABDULHAK_MR_EVIL_INVESTIGATION.md) documented separately. In Steve Bannon's iMessages with Epstein (2018–2019), "Mr. Evil" refers to a Middle Eastern political figure involved in lobbying, diplomacy, and European meetings.

**Key documents**:
- [EFTA01615037](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01615037.pdf) (DS10) — Apr 2018: "**Mr evil would like to hire a firm to lobby on behalf of war powers act**"
- [EFTA01615053](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01615053.pdf) (DS10) — Apr 26, 2018: "**Jabor is HBJ chief, mr evil**, waiting on a date from you, sultan easiest"
- [EFTA01940750](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01940750.pdf) (DS10) — Jan 19, 2014: "add to paris list, **jabor, mr evil, jean luc**" — lists Jabor and Mr Evil as SEPARATE items
- [EFTA01614416](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01614416.pdf) (DS10): "Should we ask Mr Evil and company to come? **Salem** is a key guy"
- [EFTA01615283](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01615283.pdf) (DS10) — Aug 2018: "mr evil willing to meet you in europe"
- [EFTA01615501](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01615501.pdf) (DS10): "**Mr evil. Ehud hbj etc**"
- [EFTA01615796](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01615796.pdf) (DS10) — Apr 2019: "Mr evil sends his regards" / Bannon: "**Love me some mr evil**"
- [EFTA01616087](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01616087.pdf) (DS10): "Someone on pompeo team should sit with mr evil. They will do a 180 on their sponsor in a heartbeat"
- [EFTA01614980](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01614980.pdf) (DS10): Bannon asks "Mr Evil??" — Epstein responds "no kim Jung" — shows Bannon knows the codename but needed clarification on a specific person

**Analysis**: EFTA01940750 lists "jabor, mr evil, jean luc" as three separate people, confirming Mr Evil ≠ Jabor. Mr Evil is listed alongside Jabor (HBJ's chief), "Sultan," "Salem," "Ehud" (Barak), and "HBJ" (Hamad bin Jassim, former PM of Qatar). The figure is involved in War Powers Act lobbying, Iraq/Gulf diplomacy, and could influence "their sponsor" to do "a 180." Gulf context, but identity not established.

**Relationship to Abdulhak Mr. Evil**: The Bannon-context "Mr. Evil" may or may not be the same person as the Abdulhak "Mr. Evil" documented in the separate investigation. The Abdulhak identification rests on 57 documents with 5 independent proofs. The Bannon political context involves different subject matter (lobbying, diplomacy vs. business). Further investigation needed to determine if "Mr. Evil" is a codename Epstein applied to one person consistently or used for different people in different circles.

## Part 4: Encrypted Communications & Operational Security

### Shared ProtonMail Account: `jmje@protonmail.com`

**Parties**: Jeffery A. Martin (consciousness researcher) and Jeffrey Epstein
**Setup**: Jul 12, 2017 — Martin sends Epstein the shared login via Skype

- [EFTA01621829](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01621829.pdf) (DS10) — Skype chat, Jul 12, 2017:
  - Martin: "Hi Jeffrey, check your email and this will make sense: Username: jmje@protonmail.com"
  - Epstein: "can't log in says incorrrect"
  - Martin: "Try just jejm without the @domain"
  - Epstein: "your first username was JM JE i got in on last JE JM thx"

**Significance**: This is a **shared inbox** — both parties access the same ProtonMail account to exchange messages without creating a sender/recipient paper trail. ProtonMail is end-to-end encrypted and based in Switzerland.

The Skype conversation also reveals Martin discussing arranging "3 key people" for a meeting and "2 key people for house, etc. clearing/protection," using language suggesting operational planning. Martin tells Epstein about needing to do "personal massaging" and references something described as "the secret" ([EFTA01621829](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01621829.pdf), page 4).

### Signal App Recruitment

Vincenzo Iozzo (Italian cybersecurity researcher) sent Epstein a direct download link for the Signal encrypted messaging app:

- [EFTA01780677](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01780677.pdf) (DS10) — Apr 11, 2016: "This is the direct link... You'll find at least me (+13474093908) and **Joi** on it. It takes the numbers/contacts from your address book. Absolutely unrelated: indiscrete thoughts by Carlo rota is a book you'd like I reckon"

**"Joi" = Joi Ito** (then-director of MIT Media Lab). Ito and Iozzo were already on Signal and recruiting Epstein to join.

Additional Signal usage:
- **Terje Norderhaug** to Epstein ([EFTA01614476](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01614476.pdf), DS10, Oct 13, 2018): "Pls call on signal when up"
- **Samantha Rose Stein** to Epstein ([EFTA02605635](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02605635.pdf), DS11, Jan 2019): "lets schedule a call on signal this week. How's tomorrow some time between 1:30-3pm PST? I can be reached at 202-769-6747." (Also uses ProtonMail.)

### Bannon Circle ProtonMail Usage

Steve Bannon's circle extensively used ProtonMail:
- **Dan Fleuette** (Bannon aide): `doitfluet@protonmail.com` — coordinated Bannon's May 2019 trip to Epstein's island via ProtonMail ([EFTA02284049](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02284049.pdf), [EFTA02284141](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02284141.pdf), DS11)
- **Sean Bannon** (Steve's son): Sent Trump@War film link to Epstein "from my ProtonMail" ([EFTA02604944](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02604944.pdf), DS11, Aug 23, 2018)
- **Samantha Rose Stein**: "Sent with ProtonMail Secure Email" + requests Signal calls ([EFTA02605635](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02605635.pdf), DS11)

### Epstein's Multi-Platform Encrypted Messaging Setup (May–October 2018)

Epstein set up multiple encrypted messaging platforms in 2018 — WeChat first in May, then Signal and WhatsApp on the same day in October:
- **WeChat**: [EFTA01620922](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01620922.pdf) (DS10) — May 13, 2018: WeChat verification codes
- **Signal**: [EFTA01618899](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01618899.pdf) (DS10) — Oct 13, 2018: Verification code to +1 (702) 660-4496 (Las Vegas number)
- **WhatsApp**: [EFTA01613649](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01613649.pdf) (DS10) — Oct 13, 2018: Multiple verification codes same day as Signal

### Samantha Rose Stein — ProtonMail + Signal (Jan–Feb 2019)

Stein used ProtonMail and Signal for ALL communications with Epstein:
- [EFTA02605635](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02605635.pdf) (DS11) — Jan 2019: "HNY. Do you use signal? It is an encrypted app that I prefer to use for communications."
- Epstein asked "do you have a preferred name to use?" — suggesting a pseudonymous venture
- She proposed "**Truth Robot LLC**" as the entity name. Epstein: "ok with me, start looking for investments"
- Discussed "like minded women" — Epstein asked "if you were to choose 4 to join your club, who would they be?"
- All communications encrypted end-to-end (ProtonMail + Signal)

### ProtonMail for Discovery Avoidance

Beyond the shared jmje@protonmail.com account (see above), ProtonMail was explicitly recommended and used to avoid legal exposure:
- **Jeffery A. Martin** ([EFTA02643105](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02643105.pdf), DS11): "I've given your interests in the stranger aspects of my PNSE research a lot of thought while here in India. **You seem to get sued a lot, and I don't like documents showing up in discovery**"

### Passwords in Plain Text

Multiple passwords appear unencrypted in the corpus, revealing Epstein's weak operational security:

| Password | Account | Context | Key EFTA |
|----------|---------|---------|----------|
| `jeevacation12` | Yahoo (`jeffreyepsteinorg@yahoo.com`) / Flickr | "for your records your yahoo and flikr user/password is: jeffreyepsteinorg@yahoo.com / jeevacation12" | [EFTA02030386](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02030386.pdf), [EFTA01873430](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01873430.pdf) |

**Note**: All three passwords are trivially guessable — "jeevacation" + "12", "jen" + "12", a simple word. No two-factor authentication. Staff shared passwords openly via email.

### Anonymous Donor Channels

- **MIT / Joi Ito**: "I had MIT set up a special account for you as an **anonymous donor** so we don't have to go through an intermediary non-profit. I assume you don't mind if we can't talk about it publicly right?" Epstein: "i never mind, these things" ([EFTA01754963](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01754963.pdf), [EFTA01948626](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01948626.pdf), DS10, Nov 14, 2013)

### Aviation Entity Chain: Air Ghislaine → Shmitka Air → Freedom Air

All THREE names were the **same JPMorgan checking account** — a classic entity-layering pattern ([EFTA01654901](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01654901.pdf)).

- **Air Ghislaine Inc.**: JPM due diligence 02/05/2009 under banker Mary C Casey ([EFTA01582846](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01582846.pdf)).

Indyke listed as Vice-President ([EFTA01811593](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01811593.pdf)). Sikorsky accused Shmitka of "being brokers" ([EFTA01824387](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01824387.pdf))
- **Freedom Air International Inc.**: JPM account #739-474324. $10,901,000 transfer to FSF, LLC at FirstBank Puerto Rico ([EFTA01589259](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01589259.pdf))

## Part 6b: Pseudonyms in Professional/Business Contexts

### FT Style Writer Under Fake Name

A person in Epstein's circle writing for the Financial Times under a pseudonym:
- [EFTA01817570](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01817570.pdf) (DS10): "I've been writing for the **FT style section (under a fake name)** and friendly with some of the fancy designer types." Same person: "I manage several different portfolios of Special Projects whose grants/commitments total about $315M."

### Jennifer "French" (Mother's Maiden Name)

- [EFTA01847527](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01847527.pdf) (DS10) — Dec 6, 2011: "**Jennifer goes by last name French** (mom's maiden)." Person in Epstein's circle operating under a different surname.

### Jeremy Rubin / Deploy Capital — "Just Jeff" Pseudonym Proposal

Rubin (MIT grad, Bitcoin developer) proposed Epstein participate in crypto investment calls under a partial pseudonym:

- [EFTA02601272](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02601272.pdf) (DS11, Jul 16–17, 2018): Rubin: "I'll just schedule a time for them to talk to my 'due diligence advisor/team'. You can phone in and ask whatever you like, under a pseudonym (even just first name, not last name). You can open with something like, 'Hi this is **Jeff**, I'm helping Jeremy check out what you're planning to do with Layer One and make sure it's going to be a good investment for **Deploy Capital**.' I think that should be fine, and is not inaccurate, just imprecise."
- Epstein: "investments are people focused. and neither you nor vincenzo yet have the experience" ([EFTA02602102](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02602102.pdf))
- Concern was explicit: "potential investments googling your name might get spooked (especially given SF politics)"

**Financial structure**: Rubin was paid $25,000/quarter ($100K/year) by Gratitude America Ltd via Deutsche Bank ([EFTA01348717](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01348717.pdf), [EFTA01348712](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01348712.pdf)). Deploy Capital was the fund Rubin ran with Epstein's backing. Vincenzo Iozzo (Italian cybersecurity researcher) co-managed investments.

**Did Epstein participate under pseudonym?** LIKELY YES but not confirmed. The EFTA02601272 email is a proposal, not a confirmed action. However Iozzo was actively sourcing deals (Layer1, Bitmain pre-IPO $1M allocation) and seeking Epstein's input.

**Disturbing exchange** — [EFTA01743596](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01743596.pdf) (DS10, Sep 8, 2016): Rubin asked Epstein about tax-free settlement transfers: "I want x-fer money from Bob to Alice. Bob starts a company, then hires Alice. Bob touches Alice inappropriately or something. Bob settles to Alice. Can Alice/Bob not pay taxes on that?" Epstein: "if the reason EVENT is due to physical damage. no tax. emotional damage. tax." Rubin: "So... the trick is to cause phys damage without being a criminal thing."

### Epstein's SEO/PR Anonymity

Epstein explicitly refused to have his name used in a PR/search-engine optimization campaign:
- [EFTA02033106](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02033106.pdf) (DS10) — Dec 26, 2010: Scott Denett: "the concept of using your name was to control the PR google search results to push away article we don't like." Epstein: "**there is no reason to use my name or initials. thanks.**"

- Follow-up: Cross-reference with financial entity records; identify "ehbarak" contact

### "Christian" (Germany) — Assistant Recruiter

### Samantha Rose Stein / "Truth Robot LLC"
- Used ProtonMail + Signal exclusively with Epstein (Jan-Feb 2019)

- Proposed "Truth Robot LLC" entity
- Discussed "like minded women" — Epstein asked who would join "your club"
- Follow-up: Was the entity actually formed? What investments were made?

## Part 8: Debunked, Literal, and Conspiracy Claims

This section documents claims that were investigated and found to be literal references, misattributions, or conspiracy fabrications. Included to prevent re-investigation of resolved questions.

### Debunked Food Codenames (Conspiracy Theory)

Social media and some outlets claimed various food terms in the Epstein files were trafficking codes. **All debunked by fact-checkers.** The food references are ordinary meal planning for a large household.

| **"Lady Ghislaine" = Maxwell email signature** | **PARTIALLY CONFIRMED.** Term appears in corpus primarily as Robert Maxwell's yacht name and in news articles about him. Bloomberg's claim that Ghislaine used it as an email signature is NOT corroborated by corpus email headers | Yacht confirmed; email signature claim unverified |

### The Trump Codename Question — ANALYZED

**~7,889 documents** in the corpus mention "Donald Trump" or "Trump" by name. This volume of by-name references is strong evidence that Trump did **not** require a codename within Epstein's inner circle — he was discussed openly.

**Internet-claimed Trump codenames, corpus-checked:**

| Claimed Codename | Corpus Finding | Status |
|------------------|----------------|--------|
| "MacGyver" | Ruemmler COMPARED Trump to MacGyver ("similar mannerisms") — implies they are different people. Corpus evidence points to Benjamin Brafman (see Part 1) | **DISPUTED** — see MacGyver entry above |
| "The Donald" | Used openly by Epstein, Bannon, Mandelson, Ruemmler, Soon-Yi Previn, Landon Thomas Jr. | **Public nickname, NOT a codename** |
| "Boy Donald" | Mark Epstein to Jeffrey: "what is your boy Donald up to now?" | **Casual nickname from brother, NOT a codename** |
| "Bubba" | Mark Epstein email; Mark later denied it referred to Clinton | **Disputed, NOT confirmed as Trump** |
| "The Apprentice" | Epstein's term for young women in "Agreement of Favors" contracts | **NOT about Trump's TV show** |
| "The big guy" | CONFIRMED in corpus: Weingarten to Epstein re: "hard facts that are very difficult for the big guy to explain" ([HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_032821](https://epstein-data.com/full_text_corpus/pages?efta_number=HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_032821)); Landon Thomas: "Maybe even the big guy gives it a read... from the failing NYT" ([EFTA02367893](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02367893.pdf)). **BUT ALSO**: Fiszel to Kahn: "Does the big guy have any friends?" = Epstein in financial context ([EFTA01031195](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01031195.pdf)) | **NOT a codename** — context-dependent phrase (= Trump in political contexts, = Epstein in financial contexts) |
| "That dog that hasn't barked" | Epstein to Maxwell, Apr 2, 2011 | **Sherlock Holmes literary reference, NOT a codename** |

**Conclusion**: The corpus does not support the existence of a secret Trump codename. Trump was discussed by name thousands of times. The "MacGyver" identification (Defector) rests on one email that actually COMPARES Trump to MacGyver, and the corpus evidence points to a defense attorney instead. Per our POTUS protocol: all evidence presented for both interpretations; no conclusion drawn; labeled DISPUTED where ambiguous.
