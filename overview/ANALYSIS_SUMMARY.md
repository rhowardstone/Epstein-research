## POWERFUL MEN VICTIMS WERE "LENT OUT" TO

| Name | Evidence |
|------|----------|
| **Glen Dubin** | Maxwell "explicitly told [victim] she had to do to Glen what she did for Epstein" |
| **Prince Andrew** | Maxwell told victim to "make him happy and do the exact same things for him that she did for Epstein because the prince was a good friend of Maxwell's" |
| **Leon Black** | "engaged in sexual contact with her against her will during the massage" |
| **Jes Staley** | "engaged in sexual contact with her against her will" - **CORROBORATED BY MESSAGES between Staley and Epstein** |
| **Harvey Weinstein** | "directed her to remove her shirt" during massage |
| **Alan Dershowitz** | "mentioned...but we did not fully explore the details of her interactions with him" |

**Note:** DOJ was "in the process of obtaining the name of a lawyer who represents Prince Andrew" to request an interview.

## EPSTEIN'S WEALTH SOURCE

Per Wexner's lawyers' attorney proffer:

- **"That misconduct, together with fees that Epstein paid himself for his services to Wexner, appears to account for virtually all of Epstein's wealth"**
- Wexner recovered $100M in January 2008, severed all ties

- Jean Luc Brunel (died in custody)

## LEON BLACK - SENATE INVESTIGATION ([EFTA02731023](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731023.pdf))

Senate Finance Committee letter to Leon Black (July 24, 2023):

| Finding | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Total paid to Epstein | **$158 million** (2012-2017) |
| Annual rate | $23-26 million/year |
| Written contract | **NONE** for payments over $100M |
| Tax savings | **$1 billion+** in gift/estate taxes |
| Wealth transferred | **$2 billion** to children |
| Black's response | **Refused to answer** questions about payments |

**KEY QUESTION:** Why pay Epstein $158M with no contract, at rates exceeding Fortune 500 CEO pay, when a victim says Black "engaged in sexual contact with her against her will" at Epstein's residence?

## REVISIT CORRECTIONS (2026-02-12)

1. **"Cuomo" on Prominent Names page:** The "Cuomo" referenced on the FBI Prominent Names page ([EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf)) is a **victim surname** (Tony Cuomo, [EFTA02696360](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02696360.pdf) -- invited to Epstein's NY house in January 2012), not former Governor Andrew Cuomo.

2. **Leon Black $158 million:** This figure is the Senate Finance Committee's stated number from their letter ([EFTA02731023](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731023.pdf)). Independent analysis of Deutsche Bank wire exhibits ([EFTA00080260](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00080260.pdf)) documents $118.5M+ through bank records, with the total potentially reaching higher through additional channels. The $158M figure has not been independently verified by DOJ exhibits.

3. **Jes Staley evidence strengthened:** Staley was classified by prosecutors as among "Individuals Who Have Engaged in Massages with Epstein Girls" ([EFTA00098755](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00098755.pdf)), alongside Glenn Dubin. Two violent rape accusations are documented in [EFTA00090717](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00090717.pdf).

4. **Victim count expanded:** Subsequent investigations confirmed minimum 60-80 individually identified victims, likely 200+ total.
