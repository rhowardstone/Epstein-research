## REMAINING UNEXPLORED AREAS

1. **Image/Video Review Results**: What was found during the Oct 2020 protocol review of Epstein's devices?
2. **Austrian passport follow-up**: Was Marius Fortelni contacted? What was the purpose of the Saudi residence entry?
3. **Bannon texts content**: Were Bannon-Epstein texts ever obtained via separate warrant?
4. **ESWW SEC filing verification**: Can the Epstein Financial Trust/Apollo ESWW connection be verified independently?
5. **CBP officer identity**: Identified as "Bill Rouch" -- agriculture/customs specialist at STT. Visoski had his number stored as "Customs STT." Direct email evidence of pilot-officer communication Jan 2016 ([EFTA00572782](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00572782.pdf), [EFTA00080458](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00080458.pdf)).

9. **12 TB of raw device data**: What was ultimately found in the full Epstein digital corpus?
10. **Ms. Vicki**: Female facilitator in FL and CA still completely unidentified

## SESSION 9 CONTINUED FINDINGS (Post-Summary)

### 12. Prosecution Failures Analysis ([PROSECUTION_FAILURES_ANALYSIS.md](/institutional/PROSECUTION_FAILURES_ANALYSIS.md) - 35KB)
- **Architecture of Impunity**: NPA co-conspirator immunity clause was not in original draft, expanded during negotiations by the Kirkland & Ellis defense team
- **Acosta deposition** ([EFTA00009016](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%207/EFTA00009016.pdf)): "I did not recall focusing on the coconspirator provision"
- **Dershowitz and the co-conspirator immunity timeline**: Dershowitz was part of the defense team that negotiated the NPA. Allegations against him emerged publicly in 2014 — years after the 2007-2008 NPA. Whether the blanket immunity was designed to protect any specific individual cannot be established from available documents.
- **Defense team pressure** ([EFTA00009116](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%207/EFTA00009116.pdf)): Acosta stated "the book reference was that I might be personally embarrassed" — the defense team raised the threat of a book chapter on prosecutorial overreach (specific team member not identified in transcript)
- **CVRA violations**: NPA deliberately concealed from victims; Judge Marra found government "chose to conceal the existence"
- **Prince Andrew**: MLAT request filed April 2020, Andrew systematically refused cooperation, never charged
- **Leon Black**: 4+ victims, FBI 302s, $62.5M USVI settlement - SDNY CRU "doesn't intend to open anything separate"
- **Jes Staley**: Rape allegation flagged by SDNY prosecutor, coordinated FCA investigation, no charges anywhere
- **Bill Richardson**: "So, so frustrating" - SDNY frustration over counsel obstruction, never subpoenaed
- **Dershowitz**: Never investigated despite multiple victims naming him (beginning in 2014); was part of the defense team that negotiated the NPA with its co-conspirator immunity clause
- **Dubins**: Victim used term "lent out," Eva Dubin described as present, no investigation
- **Kellen/Marcinkova**: "Hundreds of sexual massages with minors" - plea negotiations collapsed, no charges
- **Brunel**: Died in French prison Feb 2022 before trial (pattern: both seriously prosecuted individuals died pre-trial)
- **BOP employees**: DOJ OIG investigated, SDNY declined to prosecute ([EFTA00035812](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00035812.pdf))
- **Pattern**: At every stage, prosecutors narrowed rather than expanded investigations

### 13. Deutsche Bank Financial Architecture (Codex forensic workbench integration)
- **RM CODE 82289**: Single relationship manager code covering ALL Epstein entities at Deutsche Bank
- **[EFTA01359500](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01359500.pdf)**: Complete account officer roster shows **same two bankers** (Jj Litchford primary, Paul Morris secondary) managed:

- **Benjamin Edmond de Rothschild**: $25M (Dec 2015) to Southern Trust
- **Tudor Futures Fund** (Paul Tudor Jones): $13.5M (Aug 2014) to Southern Financial
- **Kellerhals Ferguson Kroblin PLLC**: $23M (Nov 2015) - law firm wire
- **Blockchain Capital IV, LP**: $15M (Feb 2018) to The 2017 Caterpillar Trust
- **Post-KYC breach (after Apr 16, 2018)**: 50 transactions totaling $189M continued flowing
- **KYC breach documented**: "kyc is not happening" ([EFTA01362456](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01362456.pdf))
- **AML alert**: "URGENT - THIRD REQUEST!!!!!" ([EFTA01414241](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01414241.pdf))

### 14. NTOC Tips - Allen/Oren/Tal Brothers ([EFTA01660651](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660651.pdf), [EFTA01660679](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660679.pdf))
- NTOC tip: At age 16 while modeling, caller attended 8 parties at Epstein's NY residence
- **Three brothers** (Allen, Oren, and Tal) participated in rapes at Epstein's parties
- "Two twin brothers, Allen and Oren, lured caller and her friend upstairs"
- "Oren raped her best friend and a third brother, Tal, raped a 14 year old girl named Katie LNU"
- Same caller named "big orgy parties" with "other young girls and older Victoria's Secret models, including Bill Clinton and Donald Trump"
- This appears on same NTOC page as other tips including the Trump Golf Course/Rancho Palos Verdes tip (deemed not credible)

### 15. Codex Financial Analysis Summary
- 186 normalized transactions in forensic workbench database
- Total amount represented: **$755,632,579**
- Post-KYC breach transactions: 50 totaling $189M
- **Dominant corridors**: Haze Trust → Southern Financial ($39.7M outflow), Southern Trust → Honeycomb Partners ($33M, 4 txns), Haze Trust → Southern Financial ($22M, 3 txns)
- **Same-day bundled transfers** suggest coordinated movement: DB-SDNY-0006153 ($72M same-day), DB-SDNY-0008063 ($24.5M cluster) *(DB-SDNY Bates numbers are Deutsche Bank production references from [EFTA00027019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027019.pdf))*
- **Gratitude America, Ltd**: Epstein entity making payments to NPO Baleto Teatras (Lithuanian ballet) and Cancer Research Wellness Institute
- **Strongest evidence of banker misconduct**: $23M approval workflow ([EFTA01431221](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01431221.pdf)), stop-wire attempted after already processed ([EFTA01426081](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01426081.pdf)), KYC breach with continued servicing
- **Legal assessment**: Strong institutional knowledge + control failure + suspicious transaction handling, but not yet individual criminal attribution without additional transaction metadata

### 16. Ruemmler Deep Intelligence Findings
- **[EFTA02575359](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02575359.pdf)** (Oct 29, 2017): Epstein to Ruemmler: "why would they file a sealed indictment? if it is true" - **sent the day before Manafort indictment unsealed** (Oct 30, 2017).

- T&M Protection Resources (Epstein family's private security firm) classified the emails as "harassing" ([EFTA00037236](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037236.pdf)) and conducted email header analysis ([EFTA00146777](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00146777.pdf))
- FBI received letters and met with T&M ([EFTA00037232](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037232.pdf)) but no FD-302 interview, case serial, or documented follow-up exists

### 55. Documented Blackmail Operation
- **[EFTA00021553](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021553.pdf)**: Jane Doe #3 testified Epstein trafficked her to "prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known Prime Minister" and "required Jane Doe #3 to describe the events... so that he could potentially blackmail them"

- This confirms the existence of classified intelligence-related material about Epstein that was withheld under FOIA exemptions

### 57. Israel-Related Search Findings (Updated)
- **DS9 corpus overturns prior "ZERO" findings from redaction/OCR databases**: Carbyne (50 docs), Reporty (324 docs), Unit 8200 (11 docs), Shin Bet (23 docs), Mega Group (4 docs) all found in full_text_corpus.db. Epstein invested $500K in Carbyne; Barak had $1.5M carry at $50M valuation. The prior "ZERO" results were an artifact of searching only redaction/OCR databases, not the DS9 email corpus.
- FBI CHS FD-1023 ([EFTA00090314](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00090314.pdf)) contains claim that "Epstein belonged to both U.S. and allied intelligence services" and "trained as a spy under" Barak -- unverified CHS claims but present in the FBI case file
- **MC2 + Tel Aviv recruiting**: ZERO direct results in available databases (MC2's documented ages 13-20 requirement confirmed from actual website)
- No explicit foreign intelligence service connection established despite infrastructure consistent with such operations
- "Mossad" appears only in external correspondence, never in FBI investigative documents
- Israeli intelligence agency references are largely absent from the 1.8M+ redaction/OCR records, though DS9 full-text corpus does contain Carbyne/Reporty/Unit 8200/Shin Bet references (mostly in news articles)

- **[EFTA02484285](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02484285.pdf)** (October 12, 2015): Epstein writes: "seen as the good friend that you are. might bring unhelpful criticism of the important role model that you have become for women... defense counsel might create **clinton obama unnecessary implication**. either way I appreciate the help but we should be extra thoughtful. as surrounded by publicity seeking lawyers."
- Shows Epstein: (a) acknowledging Ruemmler was providing "help," (b) warning about political implications for Clinton and Obama, (c) concern about publicity
- Discussions about a "Nigerian" decision-maker who is "predisposed to empower women" (**[EFTA02570921](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02570921.pdf)**) — possibly related to Goldman Sachs board appointment

Shaw** (billionaire), **Yann LeCun** (Facebook AI/Turing Award), **John Hopfield** (Princeton). Gershenfeld cc's "Jeff" for guest list approval

- **[EFTA01774075](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01774075.pdf)**: Anonymous sender asking for apartment use Jan 10-14, signs "xo" — post-conviction
- **[EFTA02696356](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02696356.pdf)**: "Jennie Enterprise" (CORE, 66 East 55th St) — Africa travel reference
- **[EFTA01793116](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01793116.pdf)**: "Scott" wants to know if Epstein in St. Thomas, having "his friend fly to [the island] to keep him company at night" — sent 70 minutes before Russian woman's email

- Remote-id progression (19,372 → 542,078 over 2009-2015) implies **~520,000+ emails**, ~225/day

### 83. PLIST Timestamp-Transaction Correlation Analysis
- **420 Unix timestamps** extracted from Apple Mail PLIST metadata across 424 records
- **$13.5M Tudor Futures (Aug 2014) — STRONGEST CORRELATION**: 21 emails within 14 days; on exact transfer date (Aug 15), Epstein messaged someone identified as "President" asking "tomorw?" August 2014 = single highest-activity month (23 emails, 4.2x monthly average)
- **Leon Black "sensitive accounts" ([EFTA02664953](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02664953.pdf), Dec 21, 2016)**: JE instructed Black to "liquidate the J BLACK trust," alarmed about Wechsler telling people about "sensitive accounts" — 10 days before $30.5M Sotheby's/Christie's cluster

Same day: JE emailed Richard Kahn re trustee replacements, Bain lawsuit, account statements
- **99-DAY PLIST GAP (Nov 14, 2018 -- Feb 21, 2019)**: ZERO Apple Mail PLIST emails during this period. However, DS9 shows continuous daily jeevacation@gmail.com email activity throughout (Summers, Barak, Ruemmler, Church, Bannon proxy contacts, Mitchell). The PLIST gap is a DS11 extraction artifact reflecting Apple Mail export limitations, not actual communication silence. The underlying activity -- Miami Herald response, $100K Marcinkova payment, December emergency wires, $31.5M dissolution event -- is documented in DS9 email records.
- **Ariane de Rothschild ([EFTA02502971](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02502971.pdf), Apr 2015)**: "this is my new email address that nobody can access" — deliberate untraceable channel creation, **8 months before $25M Rothschild→Southern Trust transfer**

- **Forensic tools**: Cellebrite (CCO + CCPA certified), EnCase, FTK, XRY, Blacklight, BlackBag, BERLA Vehicle Forensics, IACIS
- **MCC DVR catastrophic failure**: DVR 2 (3 of 4 camera angles on Epstein's cell) failed July 29, 2019 — 12 days before death. FBI Advanced Data Recovery at Quantico failed to recover. **No recordings exist after July 29**
- **UNSEARCHED 2005 COMPUTER**: 16 DVDs containing Palm Beach PD EnCase forensic image from **peak abuse period** — NEVER examined. FBI lacked legal authority (2005 warrant = seizure only). Estate refused privilege waiver
- **Processing dysfunction**: 17+ month evidence mishandling. AUSA: "the FBI is completely fucking us on this." 1.1M initial documents, no email-to-attachment linking, mismatched control numbers, no device attribution. COVID reduced FBI examiner to 1 day/week. 71K zero-byte files. 2 server drives physically failed. **6+ machines still unexported Oct 2020**
- **2,100 nude/partially nude images/videos** on devices + 3,400 from discs + 7 hard-copy from FL file = classified as "obscene material"
- **Relativity**: FBI explicitly warned it "is NOT a forensic tool" — yet used for evidence management
- **Cross-case**: Trump-Maxwell photo found on Bannon iPhone 7 during WBTW case Cellebrite review

### 85. PLIST Overview — 460+ Apple Mail Metadata Documents
- **460+ documents** across the corpus contain Apple Property List (PLIST) metadata from Apple Mail (Mail.app) email exports
- **NOT device backups** — this is email metadata automatically embedded when emails were printed/exported from Mail.app on macOS
- **Two email accounts identified:**
  - `jeevacation@gmail.com` — Epstein's primary Gmail (45+ docs with PLIST, 683 total)
  - `sarahk525@mail.mac.com` — Sarah Kellen's Apple Mail (.mac.com = pre-iCloud Apple email)
- **Date range:** September 1, 2009 to October 5, 2018 (9 years, ending ~9 months pre-arrest)
- **Lesley Groff** = heaviest PLIST presence (40+ documents) — primary Apple Mail user for Epstein correspondence
- **Forensic value:** Unix timestamps (to-the-second precision), Gmail label IDs, conversation threading IDs, IMAP folder paths, mail client identification

### 86. PLIST in Redacted Text — 12 Failed Redaction Overlays
- **12 documents** had PLIST XML content recovered from **beneath failed redaction overlays** (bad_overlay, confidence 0.77-0.99)
- All from dataset10 (EFTA017*) and dataset11 (EFTA02*)
- Key documents: [EFTA01781767](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01781767.pdf) (includes "Sent from my iPhone" + full PLIST XML, 0.99 confidence), [EFTA01774075](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01774075.pdf) (full DOCTYPE declaration, 0.94), [EFTA02114558](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02114558.pdf) (0.99)
- **Significance:** Redaction tools failed to handle embedded XML metadata — the PLIST was part of email body text that redactors attempted to hide but didn't properly flatten

### 87. Cellebrite Device Forensics — Apple Device Evidence Chain
- **17 documents** reference Cellebrite forensic extraction software
- **[EFTA00020322](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020322.pdf)** (KEY): Government explicitly stated "images seized from Apple devices must be viewed using Cellebrite" — Cellebrite software provided on evidence hard drives
- **~2,100 electronic images/videos** from Epstein devices + ~3,400 from discs + 7 hard copy nudes from FL investigation
- **Steve Bannon's iPhone 7** ([EFTA00025553](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00025553.pdf)/00030999): During Cellebrite review, FBI found Trump-Maxwell photo on Bannon phone; prosecutor said "no need to do anything with this one"
- **[EFTA00029601](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00029601.pdf)**: FBI forensic examiner trained in Cellebrite (Feb 2009), XRY, EnCase, Forward Discovery Mac Forensics
- **[EFTA00026890](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00026890.pdf)**: Defense demanded: "Can you please explain why 2,100 + 7 'highly confidential' images have not been shared with us yet?"

### 88. Sarah Kellen Apple Mail — IMAP Mailbox Forensics
- **11 documents** with `imap://sarahk525@mail.mac.com/Sent%20Messages` in PLIST metadata
- Proves emails were stored in and exported from Kellen's Apple Mail on a Mac computer
- Key: [EFTA02310713](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02310713.pdf) — "JE said we can cancel the hotel rooms in Menlo Park, CA... He's going to cancel the trip" (June 20, 2012, timestamp 1340203692)
- [EFTA02323043](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02323043.pdf) — "any help/input would be appreciated! Thanks chica"
- `.mac.com` domain = Apple's pre-iCloud email service (pre-2012)
- **Kellen's digital footprint** in Apple Mail exports demonstrates her role as active communications coordinator

### 89. Notable PLIST-Embedded Emails — High-Profile Contacts
- **[EFTA02570971](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02570971.pdf)**: Princess Mette (Norway) — "not sure about 1pm Monday meeting" (June 22, 2013)

- **[EFTA02672121](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02672121.pdf)**: "Nina" — "contacted the lawyer and he is working on my permit... the day he's allowed visits" (Nov 2013 — during probation period)
- **[EFTA02518921](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02518921.pdf)**: Larry Visoski (Epstein's pilot) — "GIV is enroute to Teterboro now, out of holding"

  60. **LEAD VERIFICATION CORRECTIONS: (a) Flight log modification claim INVERTED — Rodgers would NOT go back to add names, explaining incomplete records not tampering; (b) CBP proffer sessions were cooperating WITNESS, not CBP officer himself — officer never charged; (c) Victim "database" claim from USVI civil suit, not FBI forensic evidence — masseuse list real but fully redacted (7 pages [EFTA00024797](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024797.pdf)); (d) Oct 2020 device review of 10 devices has NO results document — findings completely absent from all databases; (e) Austrian passport agent wrote "I will call tomorrow" July 15, 2019 — no record of call; (f) Bannon-Epstein texts never separately warranted despite same prosecutors on both cases.**
  61. **Dec 19, 2025 "poorly redacted" files RESOLVED: All 59 changed documents use invisible OCR text layer (Text Rendering Mode 3) under scanned images. Black boxes are baked JPEG pixels, not PDF overlays. Zero annotations, zero redaction objects. "Exposed text" = garbled OCR noise, not hidden content. Viral claim was overstated. One genuinely readable piece: [EFTA00001932](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%201/EFTA00001932.pdf) victim letter fragments.**
