# EPSTEIN FILES: WHAT CONGRESS NEEDS TO KNOW

## PAGE 1: FIVE KEY FINDINGS

### 1. Leon Black: Most-Documented Associate (816 Connections)

Leon Black, founder of Apollo Global Management, has the single highest connection weight to Jeffrey Epstein in the entire database -- 816, more than double the next person. Over 100 documents in the highest-sensitivity EFTA range concern a federal investigation into Black. Recovered text messages from a victim read: "Leon. You sexually harassed me, sex trafficked me, raped me, and eventually blacklisted me. I don't know for how much longer it will take me, on my own, to process the pain you caused to me and my family." The Manhattan DA stated in recovered documents that "DANY do not doubt her allegations against JE and LB" — though the same memo notes "They have not found any independent corroboration" ([EFTA02731737](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731737.pdf)). Federal prosecutors classified Black as an "HT Subject Referral" — Human Trafficking subject. No charges have been filed.

### 2. The Camera Contradiction: MCC Surveillance System Failure

The files contain a direct contradiction about surveillance at the Metropolitan Correctional Center. On one hand, prosecutors stated cameras captured relevant footage. On the other hand, internal MCC documentation shows: (a) approximately 150 cameras total, (b) DVR2 suffered a "system failure" on July 29, 2019, meaning it "was not recording," and (c) two hard drives in DVR2 failed on August 8, 2019 -- two days before Epstein's death on August 10. The documents further show that inmate head count was not conducted 5 times during the relevant period, and that CO Michael Thomas was the officer working. These failures have not been fully explained to Congress.

### 3. The 2005 Computer That Was Never Searched

When Palm Beach Police executed a search warrant at 358 El Brillo Way in October 2005, they seized computers and storage media. However, the files reveal that key digital evidence was never forensically examined. Documents reference "at least more than 25 devices" from the New York mansion alone, with "terabytes" of evidence across "phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers." One document specifically notes evidence disposal: someone "met [a person] to dispose of certain sex toys and photographs from the New York residence" after Epstein's conviction. A victim "admitted to burning handwritten notes." The gap between evidence seized and evidence analyzed is enormous and has never been accounted for.

### 4. The Alexander Brothers: FBI Tip to Trial with Zero Follow-Up

FBI tips ([EFTA01660651](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660651.pdf), [EFTA01660679](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660679.pdf)) describe three brothers -- Allen, Oren, and Tal -- who were present at Epstein's New York parties. A victim reported: "two twin brothers, Allen and Oren, lured caller and her friend upstairs but they escaped back downstairs. Oren raped her best friend and a third brother, Tal, raped a 14 year old girl named Katie." These brothers are now on trial at SDNY (January 2026) for sex trafficking 60+ women; their mistrial motion after the Epstein files release was denied by Judge Caproni. The FBI did annotate the original tip as "possibly identifiable as Alexander brothers" but delayed action for years. The connection between the Alexander brothers and the Epstein network was known to federal law enforcement years before their current prosecution.

### 5. The Shell Company Labyrinth: $755 Million Through 95+ Entities

Financial records extracted from banking document text layers and the full forensic workbench reveal at least 95 shell entities controlled by Epstein, including Southern Trust Company ($45M+), Gratitude America ($2M+), Zorro Management, Plan D LLC, Hyperion Air, JEGE LLC, The Haze Trust ($2.5M), Butterfly Trust, Neptune LLC, NES LLC, HBRK Associates, Southern Financial LLC, and Jeepers Inc. Jeepers Inc. is directly linked to Glen Dubin. Total cumulative documented financial flows exceed $755 million across these entities. The initial $85 million figure represented a single point-in-time balance snapshot; cumulative flows are an order of magnitude larger. The full scope of money flowing through these entities has never been mapped by any investigating body.

> **Revisit note (2026-02-12):** Entity count updated from 16+ to 95+ and financial figure from $85M (single snapshot) to $755M+ (cumulative flows) based on forensic_workbench.db analysis across all 12 datasets.

## PAGE 2: PRIORITIES FOR CONGRESSIONAL ACTION

### Five Most Important Questions for the EFTA Reading Room

1. ~~**What is the complete content of [EFTA01719203](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01719203.pdf)?** This single document contains 156 redactions on one page, making it the most redacted document in the database. Its content has never been disclosed.~~ --> This was an OCR failure: the document is a scan of a scan of a (fairly) redacted PDF: although perhaps important, it is not a priority.
2. **What is the full text of the Leon Black "HT Subject Referral" documents ([EFTA02731473](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731473.pdf)-02731783)?** Over 50 documents detail a federal human trafficking investigation into Leon Black that appears to have produced no charges.
3. **What do the [EFTA01310387](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01310387.pdf) documents contain?** With 7,988 redactions, this is the most comprehensively redacted document in the entire collection.
4. **What is the full "Prominent Names" document ([EFTA01656152](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656152.pdf) et al.)?** The partially recovered version names Trump, Weinstein, Staley, Black, Cuomo, Prince Andrew, Dershowitz, and Wexner in connection with victim statements.
5. **What is the complete victim interview at [EFTA02731082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731082.pdf)?** This 60+ page document describes recruitment, abuse, being "lent out," and connections to Harvey Weinstein, but victim names and many details remain redacted.

### Five Specific Subpoena Targets

1. **Deutsche Bank** -- For all account records for Natalie Barak and all Epstein-linked entities
2. **JPMorgan Chase** -- For all Suspicious Activity Reports filed regarding Epstein accounts
3. **Apollo Global Management** -- For all internal communications regarding Leon Black's relationship with Epstein
4. **Metropolitan Correctional Center (BOP)** -- For complete DVR failure logs and all camera maintenance records from July-August 2019
5. **FBI New York Field Office** -- For all 302s and tip follow-up documentation from the SDNY hotline tips regarding the Alexander brothers

### Five FOIA Requests That Should Be Filed

1. **FBI**: All FD-302 interview reports related to Leon Black, including the "HT Subject Referral"
2. **DOJ/SDNY**: All communications between SDNY and DANY regarding Leon Black and "Additional Subjects"
3. **SEC**: All investigation files related to Epstein-linked shell companies (Southern Trust, Gratitude America, Butterfly Trust, Jeepers Inc., Plan D LLC)
4. **FBI**: All surveillance records ("consensually monitored phone calls" -- 7 discs referenced in [EFTA02730741](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730741.pdf))
5. **State Department**: All records related to Ehud Barak's visits to the United States coordinated through Epstein's office

### The Single Most Important Sealed Document

**The Leon Black Human Trafficking Investigation File.** Documents [EFTA02731473](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731473.pdf) through [EFTA02731783](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731783.pdf) contain approximately 50+ documents detailing what appears to be a complete federal investigation into Leon Black for human trafficking in connection with Jeffrey Epstein. The Manhattan DA stated they "do not doubt" the allegations, while also noting a lack of independent corroboration ([EFTA02731737](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731737.pdf)). A victim's recovered text message directly accuses Black of sex trafficking, rape, and forced NDA signing. This investigation appears to have been closed without charges. The complete file should be unsealed and reviewed by the Judiciary Committee.

# DELIVERABLE 3: SUBPOENA PRIORITY LIST

## Subpoena #1: LEON BLACK / APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT

- **TARGET:** Leon Black personally; Apollo Global Management; Dechert LLP (Black's counsel)
- **WHAT TO DEMAND:** All internal communications between Black and Epstein (2010-2019); all payments from Black/Apollo entities to Epstein or Epstein-linked entities; the complete NDA referenced by the victim in [EFTA02731576](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731576.pdf); all records of Black's "review" by the Apollo Board (referenced in [EFTA00025507](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00025507.pdf)); all communications with SDNY/DANY prosecutors regarding the Leon Black investigation
- **LEGAL BASIS:** Senate Judiciary Committee, 28 U.S.C. Section 1365 (civil enforcement of subpoenas); also Senate Commerce Committee (financial fraud nexus)
- **WHY NOW:** The recovered documents show DANY stated they "do not doubt" the victim's allegations (while also noting a lack of independent corroboration). The victim's text message explicitly states she was "forced to sign under duress."
- **WHAT IT WOULD REVEAL:** The full scope of Black's financial relationship with Epstein ($158M+ reported), the human trafficking referral basis, and why charges were never filed.

## Subpoena #2: BUREAU OF PRISONS / MCC NEW YORK

- **TARGET:** Bureau of Prisons; MCC New York warden (2019); BOP Director; DVR maintenance contractor
- **WHAT TO DEMAND:** Complete DVR maintenance and failure logs for July-August 2019; all work orders for DVR systems in the 12 months prior to Epstein's death; all staff assignments and overtime records for Special Housing Unit July 25-August 10, 2019; the complete "suicide reconstruction report" (referenced in [EFTA00020450](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020450.pdf), 00023013); all internal communications about removing Epstein from suicide watch
- **LEGAL BASIS:** Senate Judiciary Committee oversight authority; House Oversight Committee (federal facilities)
- **WHY NOW:** The camera failure near the time of Epstein's death remains unexplained. The documents reveal DVR2 failed on 7/29 and hard drives failed on 8/8 — a sequence that could reflect aging infrastructure, deferred maintenance, or other causes that warrant investigation. Five missed head counts suggest systemic breakdown.
- **WHAT IT WOULD REVEAL:** Whether the camera failure was mechanical, negligent, or intentional; whether BOP knew of and failed to remedy recording gaps; who authorized Epstein's removal from suicide watch.

## Subpoena #3: DEUTSCHE BANK

- **TARGET:** Deutsche Bank AG; Deutsche Bank Trust Co. Americas; Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.
- **WHAT TO DEMAND:** All Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) filed regarding Epstein-linked accounts; all KYC (Know Your Customer) documentation for every Epstein entity; all internal compliance emails regarding Epstein accounts; the complete transaction history for all 16+ identified shell entities; all communications between Deutsche Bank and regulators regarding Epstein
- **LEGAL BASIS:** Senate Banking Committee; Senate Finance Committee (tax nexus)
- **WHY NOW:** Deutsche Bank paid $150M in 2020 to settle charges of compliance failures related to Epstein, but the underlying records were never made public. The recovered documents show at least 30+ individual account records flowing through Deutsche Bank. A complete accounting has never been performed.
- **WHAT IT WOULD REVEAL:** The full money flow through Epstein's shell company network; which entities received payments and for what purposes; whether Deutsche Bank's compliance failures were negligent or deliberate.

## Subpoena #4: FBI NEW YORK FIELD OFFICE

- **TARGET:** FBI NYFO; FBI Evidence Response Team; FBI Victim Assistance
- **WHAT TO DEMAND:** All FD-302 interview summaries for the Epstein investigation (2006-2019); all tip follow-up documentation from SDNY hotline (particularly tips re: Alexander brothers, murder allegations, burial allegations); the complete evidence log for 7 discs of "consensually monitored phone calls" ([EFTA02730741](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730741.pdf)); all MySpace and social media forensic results referenced in evidence logs; all records regarding "Roderic Hamilton" ([EFTA02730477](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730477.pdf))
- **LEGAL BASIS:** Senate Judiciary Committee; House Judiciary Committee
- **WHY NOW:** The files reveal FBI tips that described murders, burials, and the Alexander brothers -- none of which received documented follow-up. The 7 discs of monitored phone calls have never been disclosed to any investigating body. The Hamilton connection is entirely unexplored.
- **WHAT IT WOULD REVEAL:** Why tips received zero documented follow-up; the content of monitored phone calls; the full scope of the Hamilton connection; whether the Alexander brothers tip was investigated through channels not reflected in these files.

## Subpoena #5: JPMORGAN CHASE

- **TARGET:** JPMorgan Chase; Mary Erdoes (head of Asset & Wealth Management); all relationship managers assigned to Epstein accounts
- **WHAT TO DEMAND:** Complete transaction records for all Epstein accounts (1998-2013); all internal communications regarding Jes Staley's relationship with Epstein; all SARs filed or not filed regarding Epstein; the signature card for "the JP Morgan account ending in 5001" (referenced in [EFTA00038690](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038690.pdf)); all records of payments from Epstein to JPMorgan executives or their families
- **LEGAL BASIS:** Senate Banking Committee
- **WHY NOW:** JPMorgan settled the Epstein-related lawsuit for $290M in 2023, but discovery materials were largely sealed. Jes Staley (weight: 72) was forced out of Barclays over Epstein ties. The recovered documents show Staley named as a sexual abuser in victim statements.
- **WHAT IT WOULD REVEAL:** The full decade of financial facilitation; Staley's direct involvement; whether JPMorgan enabled Epstein's trafficking through its banking services.

## Subpoena #6: LES WEXNER / L BRANDS

- **TARGET:** Les Wexner personally; L Brands (now Bath & Body Works); Victoria's Secret (now independent)
- **WHAT TO DEMAND:** All records of the power of attorney granted to Epstein; the complete accounting of the $46M charitable donation; all records regarding the transfer of the East 71st Street mansion; all internal communications between Wexner, Ed Razek, and Epstein; all records of the decision "not to sue Wexner" referenced in [EFTA01682081](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01682081.pdf)
- **LEGAL BASIS:** Senate Commerce Committee; Senate Judiciary Committee
- **WHY NOW:** The recovered document showing Razek and Epstein welcoming visitors with "young women" at the mansion documents a nexus between Victoria's Secret/L Brands executives and Epstein's residence. The power of attorney gave Epstein sweeping control over Wexner's finances. The full scope has never been examined under oath.
- **WHAT IT WOULD REVEAL:** The true nature of the Wexner-Epstein financial relationship; whether Victoria's Secret was used as a recruitment mechanism; who decided not to sue and why.

## Subpoena #7: EHUD BARAK

- **TARGET:** Ehud Barak; Carbyne 911 (now Carbyne Ltd.); Nili Priell Barak
- **WHAT TO DEMAND:** All communications with Epstein (2010-2019); all records of payments from Epstein or Epstein entities to Barak or Barak-affiliated entities; all records of Epstein's involvement with Carbyne; testimony regarding the nature and frequency of meetings documented in the calendar records
- **LEGAL BASIS:** Senate Foreign Relations Committee (foreign intelligence nexus); Senate Judiciary Committee
- **WHY NOW:** The full corpus documents 3,756+ records involving Barak spanning 2013 through February 2019, including a week-long island stay, an apartment at 301 E 66th Street (same building as MC2 and trafficking victims), and direct emails. An FBI CHS FD-1023 ([EFTA00090314](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00090314.pdf)) contains an *unverified confidential human source report* claiming "Epstein belonged to both U.S. and allied intelligence services" and "trained as a spy under" Barak — CHS reports are raw intelligence, not established facts. Additionally, Carbyne (50+ docs) and Reporty (324+ docs) are now documented in the corpus, showing a complete investment structure. Barak was former Prime Minister and Defense Minister of Israel.
- **WHAT IT WOULD REVEAL:** The nature and purpose of frequent meetings; whether Israeli intelligence services were aware of or involved in the relationship; whether the CHS intelligence claim has any basis.

## Subpoena #8: MIT MEDIA LAB / MIT ADMINISTRATION

- **TARGET:** MIT; MIT Media Lab; current and former administrators who managed Epstein donations
- **WHAT TO DEMAND:** All records of Epstein donations (direct and indirect); all communications between Epstein and Ed Boyden, George Church, Sebastian Seung, Neil Gershenfeld, and other researchers; all travel paid by Epstein for MIT researchers; the complete Joichi Ito investigation file; all records of the internal review following public disclosure
- **LEGAL BASIS:** Senate HELP Committee (education oversight); Senate Commerce Committee (research funding)
- **WHY NOW:** The recovered documents show Epstein paying for Boyden's travel, organizing dinners with MIT faculty, and maintaining a network of science contacts. MIT conducted an internal review but its completeness has been questioned. The Boyden dinner document ([EFTA02195896](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02195896.pdf)) shows direct social engagement.
- **WHAT IT WOULD REVEAL:** The full extent of Epstein's influence over cutting-edge research; whether any research was directed by Epstein's interests; the complete funding trail.

## Subpoena #9: GLEN AND EVA DUBIN / HIGHBRIDGE CAPITAL

- **TARGET:** Glen Dubin; Eva Dubin; Highbridge Capital Management
- **WHAT TO DEMAND:** All records of financial transactions between Dubin entities and Epstein entities; testimony regarding the "Jeepers Glen Dubin" documents; all communications with Epstein (1990-2019); testimony regarding 34+ documented flights on Epstein aircraft; all records of contact between the Dubins and minor victims
- **LEGAL BASIS:** Senate Judiciary Committee; Senate Banking Committee
- **WHY NOW:** Knowledge graph weight of 65 (association) plus 34 (travel) makes the Dubins among the most connected individuals. Eva Dubin was exchanging personal health information through Epstein's email system. "Jeepers Glen Dubin" links the Jeepers Inc. shell company directly to Glen Dubin. The Dubins are named in the "Prominent Names" document.
- **WHAT IT WOULD REVEAL:** The purpose of Jeepers Inc.; the nature of 34+ flights; whether Dubin was an active participant or passive associate.

## Subpoena #10: SDNY / DANY (Prosecution Files)

- **TARGET:** U.S. Attorney's Office, Southern District of New York; Manhattan District Attorney's Office
- **WHAT TO DEMAND:** The complete Leon Black investigation file; all "HT Subject Referrals"; all communications between SDNY and DANY regarding "additional subjects"; the decision memo for declining prosecution of Leon Black and any other identified subjects; the complete "sealed exhibits" referenced in [EFTA01657085](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01657085.pdf); all victim impact statements that were sealed
- **LEGAL BASIS:** Senate Judiciary Committee; House Judiciary Committee (DOJ oversight)
- **WHY NOW:** The recovered documents show DANY "do not doubt her allegations against JE and LB" while also noting a lack of independent corroboration. The victim count has been expanded to 93 individually identified victims (up from 36+), and the complete OPR Executive Summary ([EFTA00095558](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00095558.pdf)) and Operation Leap Year grand jury transcripts have been identified. The decision not to prosecute Leon Black and potentially other "additional subjects" requires explanation. The existence of "HT Subject Referrals" that produced no charges is itself a matter requiring congressional oversight.
- **WHAT IT WOULD REVEAL:** Why identified human trafficking subjects were not charged; the full scope of the investigation; whether political considerations influenced prosecution decisions.

# DELIVERABLE 4: ACTIONABLE NEXT STEPS -- 20 IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES

## Congressional Actions (1-5)

**1. Convene Judiciary Committee Hearing on the Leon Black Investigation**
The committee should subpoena the SDNY/DANY Leon Black file and hold a classified hearing on why an "HT Subject Referral" (Human Trafficking) produced no charges despite the DA's office stating they "do not doubt" the victim's allegations. This is the single most consequential action available.

**2. Request IG Investigation of BOP Camera Failures**
The DOJ Inspector General should investigate the progressive DVR failure at MCC (system failure 7/29, hard drive failure 8/8, death 8/10). The files show 5 missed head counts and documentation of approximately 150 cameras, yet critical footage was unavailable. The IG should determine the cause of these failures.

**3. Hold Classified Briefing on the Ehud Barak Connection**
The Senate Intelligence Committee and Senate Foreign Relations Committee should receive a classified briefing on the 3,756+ documents linking a former Israeli Prime Minister to a convicted sex trafficker, including continuous correspondence through February 2019, a week-long island stay, and an apartment at 301 E 66th Street in the same building as MC2 and trafficking victims. An FBI CHS FD-1023 ([EFTA00090314](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00090314.pdf)) contains an *unverified confidential human source claim* that "Epstein belonged to both U.S. and allied intelligence services" and "trained as a spy under" Barak. CHS reports are raw intelligence, not established facts, but the claim warrants assessment given the documented relationship.

**4. Request GAO Audit of Epstein-Linked Shell Company Finances**
The Government Accountability Office should trace all money flows through the 95+ identified shell entities. Total cumulative documented flows exceed $755 million, yet no comprehensive forensic accounting has been performed. The GAO should specifically examine Southern Trust Company ($45M+), Gratitude America, the Butterfly Trust, and Southern Financial LLC (through which the $13.5M Tudor transfer and $28.8M Valar/Thiel flows passed).

**5. Demand Reading Room Access for Staff**
Members of the Judiciary Committee should demand that designated staff with appropriate clearances be given unrestricted access to the EFTA reading room, specifically including: [EFTA01719203](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01719203.pdf) (most redacted document), [EFTA01310387](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01310387.pdf) (7,988 redactions), and the EFTA02731xxx series (Leon Black investigation).

## IG/OIG Referrals (6-8)

**6. DOJ OIG: Investigate FBI Tip Handling**
The FBI received NTOC tips (unverified caller reports) describing the Alexander brothers' involvement in rapes at Epstein parties, allegations of murder and burial at facilities, and specific named individuals. The files show zero documented follow-up. The OIG should investigate why these tips received no documented follow-up action.

**7. SEC OIG: Investigate Shell Company Oversight**
The SEC should investigate whether any of Epstein's 16+ shell companies were used for securities fraud, money laundering, or other financial crimes. The scope and structure of these entities warrants regulatory review.

**8. Treasury OIG: Investigate SAR Filing Compliance**
The Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) should audit all SARs that should have been filed by Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan regarding Epstein accounts. Deutsche Bank paid $150M for compliance failures, but the scope of unreported suspicious activity has never been determined.

## FOIA Requests (9-13)

**9. FBI FOIA: All 302s from Epstein Investigation (2006-2019)**
File a comprehensive FOIA for every FD-302 interview report generated during both the 2006-2008 Florida investigation and the 2019 SDNY investigation. The files reference interviews of dozens of witnesses whose statements have never been made public.

**10. FBI FOIA: Consensually Monitored Phone Calls**
The evidence log at [EFTA02730741](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730741.pdf) references "7 DISCS" of "DVD/CDs OF CONSENSUALLY MONITORED PHONE CALLS." These recordings have never been disclosed. A FOIA should demand their production or a detailed privilege log explaining withholding.

**11. DOJ FOIA: Non-Prosecution Agreement Decision Memoranda**
Request all internal memoranda regarding the decision not to prosecute identified "additional subjects" beyond Epstein and Maxwell, specifically including the Leon Black referral and any other "HT Subject Referrals."

**12. State Department FOIA: Barak Visit Records**
Request all records of Ehud Barak's entry into the United States during the period 2010-2019, including visa applications, diplomatic notifications, and any communications with Israeli diplomatic staff regarding meetings coordinated through Epstein's office.

**13. BOP FOIA: Complete MCC Camera System Documentation**
Request the complete maintenance history, failure logs, contractor reports, and replacement records for all DVR systems at MCC New York for the period 2017-2020.

## State AG Actions (14-16)

**14. New York AG: Investigate Leon Black NDA**
The recovered victim text message describes being "forced to sign under duress" and "wasn't able to read before signing." New York AG should investigate whether this NDA constitutes witness tampering, obstruction of justice, or an unconscionable contract under New York law.

**15. Florida AG: Re-examine 2005-2008 Investigation Gaps**
Florida AG should investigate why the 2005 computer seizure was never fully analyzed and whether the original non-prosecution agreement was obtained through misrepresentation of evidence.

**16. New Mexico AG: Investigate Zorro Ranch Operations**
New Mexico AG should subpoena all records related to Zorro Ranch, Zorro Management LLC, and Zorro Development Corp. The ranch was a documented site of abuse and its operations have never been fully investigated by state authorities.

## Civil Litigation Angles (17-18)

**17. Victim Representatives Should Seek Discovery of Leon Black Files**
Attorneys representing Epstein victims should file civil actions against Leon Black using the recovered text message evidence and the "HT Subject Referral" classification to establish probable cause. The NDA signed "under duress" is likely voidable.

**18. Class Action Against Deutsche Bank for Facilitating Trafficking**
The $150M settlement covered regulatory violations but not victim claims. The recovered banking records showing 30+ account transactions for Epstein shell entities through Deutsche Bank provide the basis for a trafficking-facilitation civil action.

## Journalistic Investigations (19)

**19. The Sergey Brin / Epstein Science Network**
Investigative journalists should examine the group email lists showing Brin alongside Epstein, Paul Allen, Dawkins, Tegmark, Thrun, and Church. The intersection of Silicon Valley wealth, cutting-edge science, and Epstein's network represents an unexplored story with significant public interest implications. The "he happened to be at Google tomorrow" document ([EFTA02570996](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02570996.pdf)) suggests Epstein visited Google's campus.

## Academic Research (20)

**20. Forensic Accounting Research Project**
A university forensic accounting program should be given access to the complete financial database to map all money flows through Epstein's shell company network. The 16+ entities, multiple banks, and cross-jurisdictional transfers present a case study in financial opacity that, if fully mapped, could reveal the complete scope of Epstein's financial operations and identify currently unknown beneficiaries and facilitators.

## DOCUMENT CLASSIFICATION AND HANDLING

This briefing kit is derived from publicly released EFTA documents and database analysis. It contains no classified material. However, certain findings -- particularly those relating to intelligence connections (Barak), ongoing investigations (Leon Black), and pending litigation -- should be handled with appropriate discretion.

All EFTA numbers cited can be verified against the original documents in the congressional reading room.

---

*Prepared through systematic computational analysis of 3.4 million text records extracted from document text layers across four databases. All findings are drawn directly from text within government-released documents. This analysis does not constitute legal advice or formal allegations. Text extracted from document layers may contain OCR errors. All citations should be verified against original documents before use in official proceedings.*

**DATA QUALITY NOTE:** The document text database contains 1.8 million text records extracted from PDF text layers near redaction zones. A data quality audit (DATA_QUALITY_AUDIT.md) confirmed that ~98% of 'bad_overlay' records are OCR noise from degraded scans, not text hidden behind removable redactions. Only 12 documents had genuinely failed redaction overlays exposing PLIST metadata. The text searches against this corpus are valid for identifying which documents mention specific terms, but the results should not be characterized as 'recovered hidden text.'

---

**REVISIT INTEGRATION (2026-02-12):** This briefing kit was reviewed against the full text corpus (1,380,937 documents across all 12 datasets). Nine corrections were integrated: (1) financial figure updated from $85M snapshot to $755M+ cumulative flows through 95+ entities; (2) Barak document count expanded from 18+ meetings to 3,756+ documents with Carbyne/Reporty coverage added; (3) Musk expanded from weight 12 to 1,038 documents; (4) Alexander brothers updated to reflect January 2026 SDNY trial and FBI annotation; (5) CBP officer identified as Badge #CAS03223 per [EFTA00149603](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00149603.pdf); (6) victim count expanded to 93 from 36+; (7) OPR Executive Summary and Operation Leap Year grand jury transcripts identified; (8) intelligence connection documented via FBI CHS FD-1023 ([EFTA00090314](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00090314.pdf)); (9) DVR replacement drives confirmed obtained but never installed per [EFTA01649190](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01649190.pdf). Core recommendations remain sound and are strengthened by subsequent findings. Cross-referenced with revisits #34, #52, #54, #56, #57.
