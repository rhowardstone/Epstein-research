# THE ARCHITECTURE OF IMPUNITY

## A Prosecutorial Failure Narrative: The United States Department of Justice and the Jeffrey Epstein Case, 1996-2024

> **Context:** This narrative was written in early February 2026. The project has since produced **150+ investigation reports**, including deeper analysis of [prosecution failures](../institutional/PROSECUTION_FAILURES_ANALYSIS.md), [grand jury subpoenas](../pqg_lines_of_investigation/00_INDEX.md), and [individual investigations](https://epstein-data.com/reports/). This report remains accurate but covers only a portion of the full evidentiary record.

**Compiled:** February 7, 2026
**Source material:** 3.5 million+ redaction records, 38,955 OCR records, 27,231 analyzed images across four forensic databases (primary document text database, Dataset 10 document text database, OCR text extraction database, image catalog database)
**Methodology:** Exhaustive systematic search, cross-referenced with existing investigative reports
**Standard of citation:** Every material factual claim is supported by at least one EFTA document number from the DOJ production

## PREFATORY NOTE

This document is structured as a prosecutorial failure narrative -- the story of how a sex trafficking operation involving dozens of identifiable co-conspirators, hundreds of identified victims, and the most powerful people in multiple countries was allowed to function for over two decades, and how the institutional response, when it finally came, was characterized at every stage by evidence mishandling, dropped leads, narrowed investigations, and ultimately, silence.

Every failure documented below was a choice. Not to search. Not to examine. Not to charge. Not to report. The cumulative effect of these choices was the functional immunization of an entire network of abusers and facilitators.

# CHAPTER 1: 1996-2005 -- EARLY WARNINGS IGNORED

## 1.1 The 1996 FBI Source Reporting

The earliest documented federal awareness of Jeffrey Epstein's criminal conduct dates to 1996. FBI source reporting from this period is referenced in the master FBI timeline document:

> "7/24/2006 - FBI West Palm Beach RA opened investigation"

**([EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf))**

But the FBI's own case file index reveals material predating this by a decade. FBI case serial 31E-MM-108062, dated 12/6/2018, references source reporting going back to the 1990s. **[EFTA02730741](https://web.archive.org/web/20260131053030if_/https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02730741.pdf)** (note archive.org mirror: DOJ has since removed this file). The Zorro Ranch, New Mexico connection -- where a 14-year-old victim testified before the Grand Jury that she was sexually molested "in the spring of 1996" **([EFTA00008631](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%206/EFTA00008631.pdf))** -- places Epstein's criminal conduct within FBI investigative reach by the mid-1990s.

**What was not done:** No federal investigation was opened for another decade. No surveillance. No subpoenas. No undercover operations. The FBI possessed source information about a sex offender operating across state and national lines, and did nothing.

## 1.2 The 2005 Palm Beach Police Investigation

In 2005, the Palm Beach Police Department initiated its own investigation after receiving a tip from the mother of a 14-year-old victim. The police executed a search warrant at 358 El Brillo Way, Palm Beach, Florida, on October 20, 2005:

> "Upon the announcement of the search warrant, immediate contact was made with three white males who came out of the house or surrounding structures."

**([EFTA00028568](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00028568.pdf))**

The police investigation uncovered a massive operation. The FBI compilation of materials later described the scope: "from 2002 to 2005 Mr. Epstein... underage girls to his Upper East... sex acts with him." **([EFTA00018155](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00018155.pdf))**

### The Computer That Was Never Searched

During the 2005 Palm Beach investigation, a computer was seized from Epstein's residence. A forensic image was created using EnCase software, stored across 16 DVD-R discs:

> "Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office Case # 05-250067 Epstein EnCase Files Palm Beach PD DVD-R for General VERBATIM DVD Computer Crimes Unit"

Each disc was labeled "Disk 1 of 16" through "Disk 16 of 16." **([EFTA00015823](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00015823.pdf))**

**What happened next is extraordinary.** When these discs reached the FBI in New York, agents "could not open the files and believed they were inoperable." The Government later discovered the files were consistent with a forensic image of a computer -- perfectly readable with the right software. An FBI computer specialist confirmed the discs contained a complete forensic image of Epstein's 2005 Palm Beach computer. **([EFTA00015823](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00015823.pdf))**

But the 2005 search warrant "authorized seizure but did NOT authorize searching the contents of electronic devices." No subsequent warrant was ever obtained. The Government stated it had "no lawful basis to review" the forensic image and "did not intend to obtain a warrant" to search it. Epstein's estate was "repeatedly unwilling to waive any attorney-client privileges." **([EFTA00015823](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00015823.pdf))**

**This means a complete forensic image of Epstein's primary personal computer from the peak period of his abuse -- 2002-2005 -- has never been examined by federal authorities.** The 16 DVDs sat in the FBI Florida Office's file, unexamined at the federal level. (Note: The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office Computer Crimes Unit created the forensic image and may have conducted local examination — this is not addressed in the federal documents.)

### Evidence Destruction Before the Search

The prosecution's own privileged memorandum reveals that Epstein was tipped off:

> "Epstein and [redacted] directed [victim] to gather computers and directories from the Palm Beach house and give them to a man who would meet [her] there."

The victim followed these instructions. Maxwell then directed the victim to gather directories from Epstein's Virgin Islands residence, bring them to Maxwell's New York house, and shred them. **([EFTA02731082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731082.pdf))**

The same memorandum confirms:

> "Materials from the search warrant executed by the Palm Beach Police Department in 2005 confirm that computers appeared to have been removed from Epstein's Palm Beach residence prior to the search."

**([EFTA02731082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731082.pdf))**

**What was not done:** No charges for obstruction of justice or evidence tampering were ever brought against Epstein, Maxwell, or the unidentified man who received the computers. The shredding of directories was documented but never prosecuted. The removal of computers before the search was confirmed by the search warrant materials but no consequences followed.

### The Surveillance System

Further evidence of Epstein's surveillance capabilities was documented but its significance was not pursued. A 2003 Palm Beach police burglary report documented Epstein "purchasing cameras, concealing in clocks, monitoring on computer" — the camera in that instance was set up to catch a thief, but established Epstein's familiarity with concealed camera systems. **([EFTA00029761](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00029761.pdf))** The Maxwell prosecution memorandum later confirmed: "Epstein had cameras in his clock." **([EFTA02731226](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731226.pdf))**

Maxell T-160 time-lapse surveillance VHS tapes were seized from the Palm Beach residence. These tapes -- specifically designed for surveillance recording -- were catalogued in evidence but annotated: "ITEM WAS NOT SCANNED." **([EFTA00007741](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00007741.pdf), [EFTA00007984](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00007984.pdf), [EFTA00007987](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00007987.pdf), [EFTA00007990](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00007990.pdf))**

The FBI's own 2024 summary ([EFTA00038617](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038617.pdf)) contradicted the prosecution memo by stating "no bedroom cameras found." But the prosecution memo's assertion that "Epstein had cameras in his clock" went unchallenged. The VHS tapes that could have resolved this contradiction were never viewed.

**What was not done:** Surveillance tapes from a known sex offender's residence -- tapes specifically formatted for time-lapse security recording -- were seized, catalogued, and then never examined. The contents remain unknown to this day.

# CHAPTER 2: 2007-2008 -- THE NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT

## 2.1 The Architecture of the Deal

The FBI West Palm Beach RA formally opened its investigation on July 24, 2006. **([EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf))** What followed was not a prosecution but a negotiation -- one in which Epstein's defense team systematically dismantled the federal case.

Epstein assembled what U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta himself described as "an army of legal superstars":

> "Mr. Epstein hired an army of legal superstars, Harvard Professor Dershowitz, former judge and then Pepperdine lodging Ken Starr, former deputy assistant to the president then Kirkland & Ellis law partner Jay Lefkowitz, and several others, including prosecutors that formerly worked in the U.S. Attorney's Office, the child exploitation section of the Department of Justice."

**([EFTA00009116](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%207/EFTA00009116.pdf), Page 396)**

### The Dershowitz Paradox

Alan Dershowitz simultaneously served as Epstein's defense attorney while being named by multiple victims as a participant in the abuse:

> "One such powerful individual that Epstein forced then-minor Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with was former Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz... Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with Dershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida but also on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands."

**([EFTA00021553](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021553.pdf), Page 4)**

The same filing stated:

> "Dershowitz would later play a significant role in negotiating the NPA on Epstein's behalf. Indeed, Dershowitz helped negotiate an agreement that provided immunity from prosecution."

**([EFTA00021553](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021553.pdf), Page 4)**

During negotiations, Acosta described being told by the defense team:

> "I might be personally embarrassed by pursuing this matter, because I would be the subject of a chapter in a book on prosecutorial overreach."

**([EFTA00009116](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%207/EFTA00009116.pdf), Page 391)**

**What was not done:** Dershowitz was never investigated as a subject. The NPA's co-conspirator immunity clause arguably extends to him as a member of Epstein's inner circle, though allegations against him did not become public until 2014. No conflict of interest review was ever conducted regarding his dual role as defense attorney and alleged co-conspirator. No bar disciplinary proceedings resulted.

## 2.2 The Co-Conspirator Immunity Clause

The NPA contained a clause of extraordinary scope:

> "In consideration of Epstein's agreement to plead guilty and to provide compensation... the United States agrees that it will not institute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to [REDACTED NAMES]."

**([EFTA00010507](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010507.pdf), Page 8)**

Acosta testified that he did not "recall focusing on the coconspirator provision" and characterized the named co-conspirators as "lesser involved" employees. **([EFTA00009016](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%207/EFTA00009016.pdf), Page 285)**

He further admitted that granting immunity to non-cooperating co-conspirators was not standard practice:

> "Non-immunity being given to non-cooperating coconspirators, or codefendants? Is that something that was done in your office?"
>
> Acosta: "I did not get involved with these."

**([EFTA00009016](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%207/EFTA00009016.pdf), Pages 289-290)**

The line prosecutor's own email revealed additional scope: "there is no plan to try to proceed on any immigration charges against either Ms. [co-conspirator] or Ms. [co-conspirator]." The prosecutor offered to meet Epstein's counsel "off campus." **([EFTA00010507](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010507.pdf), Page 6)**

### The Main Justice Intervention

Kirkland & Ellis escalated directly to the Deputy Attorney General's office. The DAG's review ultimately concluded:

> "We do not believe such intervention is warranted here. Even if we were to substitute our judgment for that of the U.S. Attorney, we believe that federal prosecution of this case is appropriate."

**([EFTA00013555](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00013555.pdf), June 23, 2008)**

Despite this finding that federal prosecution WAS appropriate, the NPA proceeded. Acosta later explained his fear:

> "Is main justice on board, or are we going to basically be told to drop this case when it goes up to main justice?"

**([EFTA00009116](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%207/EFTA00009116.pdf), Page 237)**

The Kirkland & Ellis defense team noted that CEOS (Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section) reviewed the matter only for "abuse of discretion" -- not de novo -- making "the outcome a foregone conclusion." **([EFTA00013989](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00013989.pdf))**

## 2.3 Concealment from Victims -- The CVRA Violations

The NPA was deliberately concealed from victims in violation of the Crime Victims' Rights Act. On January 10, 2008, victims were sent letters stating the case was "currently under investigation" and requesting "continued patience" -- despite the NPA having already been signed. **([EFTA00010507](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010507.pdf), Page 16)**

Acosta's own rationale:

> "As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as potential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they were doing this for the money."

**([EFTA00014116](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00014116.pdf), August 2, 2008)**

Judge Marra subsequently found:

> "The Government... chose to conceal the existence of the NPA from the victims" and that "the Government spent untold hours negotiating the terms and implications of the NPA with Epstein's attorneys, scant information was shared with victims."

**([EFTA00010507](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010507.pdf), Page 28)**

The Government then negotiated with defense counsel about whether victims would even be told about the NPA -- "a deviation from the Government's standard practice." **([EFTA00010507](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010507.pdf), Page 9)**

Acosta acknowledged: "The CVRA isn't legally binding, it also doesn't prevent you from notifying the victims, does it?" Answer: "It does not, no." **([EFTA00009116](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%207/EFTA00009116.pdf), Page 353)**

On February 21, 2019, Judge Marra ruled that "the government violated the CVRA" -- eleven years after the violation occurred. **([EFTA00011475](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00011475.pdf))**

**What was not done:** No disciplinary consequences for any DOJ attorney involved in the concealment. OPR opened an investigation in February 2019, but Acosta had already resigned as Secretary of Labor by July 2019. The CVRA violation was found but never remedied -- the statute of limitations on most underlying criminal conduct had long since expired.

## 2.4 The State Plea as Federal Substitute

The NPA channeled Epstein into a Florida state plea. On the record at his state plea hearing, Epstein's counsel stated:

> "There is a nonprosecution agreement with the United States Attorney's office that triggers as a result of this plea agreement."

**([EFTA00027590](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027590.pdf)/[EFTA00027591](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027591.pdf), Pages 38-39)**

SDNY prosecutors later flagged this: "Check out pages 38-39 of his state plea." **([EFTA00027590](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027590.pdf))** The NPA was explicitly designed to convert a potential multi-decade federal sentence into a minimal state disposition.

Epstein served approximately 13 months of an 18-month sentence, with extraordinary work-release privileges. During his work release:

> "When he was in jail, Epstein would have his lawyer Darren Indyke and a paralegal bring him a computer, which he used to have video sex with [victim]."

> "[Victim] put on his approved driver list and would drive him back to jail at night in a suburban with a mattress in the back. Most nights, she and Epstein would park near the jail and have sex in the back of the car."

> "Epstein seemed friendly with the guards at the jail."

**([EFTA02731082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731082.pdf))**

**What was not done:** No investigation into the work-release conditions. No inquiry into the introduction of a computer into the jail for sexual purposes. No prosecution of the guards who facilitated these conditions.

---

# CHAPTER 3: 2008-2019 -- THE LOST DECADE

## 3.1 Continued Criminal Conduct Under NPA and Sex Offender Registration

After the NPA and state plea, Epstein continued operating his trafficking network without meaningful interruption:

- MC2 Model Management publicly stated its recruitment age range: "Age: Between 13 and 20 years old." **([EFTA01728258](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01728258.pdf))**
- Flight records show continuous private jet travel through 2019 on N212JE with multiple female passengers. **([EFTA00037585](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037585.pdf)-00037620)**
- A victim had "subsequent interactions with Epstein beyond November 2017, those interactions took place in December 2018 - July 2019." Epstein "lured [victim] to Paris & to Florida with offer of employment," bought her a ticket to NYC, and "JE would ask [victim] to find girls for him, and JE asked [victim] to meet with a young (18/19) girl for coffee in Russia." **([EFTA00011526](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00011526.pdf))**
- The SDNY prosecution memo documented at least "25 different men" to whom one victim was trafficked. **([EFTA02731488](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731488.pdf))**

## 3.2 Surveillance Tip Ignored (Late 2018)

In late 2018 or early 2019, a tip was received about Epstein being observed with a young girl on Palm Beach bike paths. **([EFTA00020778](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020778.pdf))**

**What was not done:** "Nothing was done." The tip was received but generated no law enforcement response, even though SDNY had already secretly opened its investigation on November 30, 2018.

## 3.3 The $100K and $250K Post-Herald Payments

On November 28, 2018, the Miami Herald published "Perversion of Justice." Within days, Epstein initiated what the prosecution memo characterized as witness management:

- **November 30, 2018:** $100,000 wire from Butterfly Trust to Aviloop LLC (Nadia Marcinkova's company) via TD Bank. **([EFTA00020685](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020685.pdf))**
- **December 3, 2018:** $250,000 wire from Butterfly Trust to a redacted individual via Bank of America. **([EFTA00020685](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020685.pdf))**

A victim stated Epstein sent money "because he felt guilty for the trouble the articles caused her." **([EFTA02731082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731082.pdf))**

**What was not done:** These payments to NPA co-conspirators -- $350,000 within five days of the Herald series -- were identified but never charged as witness tampering or obstruction.

## 3.4 The 99-Day PLIST Metadata Gap

From November 14, 2018 through February 21, 2019, Apple Mail PLIST metadata extracted from DS11 shows a gap in Epstein's device export records. However, DS9 full-text search reveals continuous daily email activity from Epstein's jeevacation@gmail.com account throughout this period, including correspondence with Summers, Barak, Ruemmler, Church, and others. The PLIST gap is an extraction artifact from the DS11 dataset methodology, not evidence of actual email silence.

During this same period, Epstein remained operationally active:

- Epstein flew at least 8 documented flights on N212JE **([EFTA00037585](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037585.pdf)-00037620)**
- He wrote continuous checks from his personal account **([EFTA01670642](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01670642.pdf))**
- He wired $350,000 to associates **([EFTA00020685](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020685.pdf))**
- His lawyer Darren Indyke flew with him on January 6, 2019 **([EFTA00037618](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037618.pdf))**
- His assistant Lesley Groff purchased a Moscow-to-NYC round-trip ticket the day the Herald published **([EFTA02265040](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02265040.pdf))**
- The FBI formally opened its investigation on December 6, 2018 **([EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf))**
- SDNY was building its case: "Yes. As of today. On the d/l for now." **([EFTA00018653](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00018653.pdf))**

**What was not done:** No one cross-referenced the DS11 PLIST metadata against the DS9 email corpus to resolve the apparent discrepancy between the metadata gap and the actual email traffic. The encrypted communications channels referenced in the corpus (Signal, WhatsApp, PGP, Telegram, ProtonMail **([EFTA00035482](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00035482.pdf), [EFTA01660663](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660663.pdf))**) remain unexamined, but the premise that Epstein went silent during this period is not supported by the full corpus.

# CHAPTER 4: JULY 2019 -- THE ARREST AND THE EVIDENCE CATASTROPHE

## 4.1 What Was Seized

On July 6, 2019, Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport. An iPhone and iPad were seized from his person. **([EFTA00015561](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00015561.pdf), [EFTA00028481](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00028481.pdf))** The same day, a search warrant was executed at 9 East 71st Street, his New York mansion. The seizure was massive:

**New York Mansion:**
- 10 desktop computers (Apple, HP, Dell, MSI, Cube 9000 Siteserver)
- 3 laptops (Sony Vaio, Toshiba, HP)
- 6 phones and tablets (iPhone, 4 iPads)
- 9 Seagate hard drives, multiple USB drives, SD cards
- 100+ optical discs across multiple binders
- 3 voice recorders (Sony, Olympus, Radio Shack)
- 2 cameras (Sony, Nikon)
- A locked safe containing: 48 loose diamonds (1-2.38 carats), a ring, $70,000+ in cash, "Nudes 1" and "Girl pics nude" photographs (some appearing underage), and an Austrian passport under the name Marius Fortelni listing Saudi Arabia as place of residence **([EFTA00021576](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021576.pdf), [EFTA00024584](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024584.pdf), [EFTA00014493](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00014493.pdf))**

**([EFTA00038465](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038465.pdf) -- Master CART Evidence Inventory)**

**USVI / Little St. James Island (August 2019):**
- 8+ Mac desktops

- HP server with 4x 500GB drives
- Multiple server racks and networking equipment
- Panasonic telecom system
- 5 HP/Lenovo Windows towers
- Unifi Cloud Key, NVR, and server
- 1 digital voice recorder

**([EFTA00038465](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038465.pdf))**

**Total estimated devices: 70-80+, comprising terabytes of data.** **([EFTA00010440](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010440.pdf))**

## 4.2 The 17-Month Processing Debacle

What followed the seizure was a forensic processing disaster documented in agonizing detail across dozens of internal emails. The timeline tells the story:

| Date | Event | Source |
|------|-------|--------|
| July-Aug 2019 | Devices seized from NY mansion, USVI, and Epstein's person | [EFTA00038465](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038465.pdf) |

### The March 9, 2020 Email

The most candid assessment came from an AUSA who wrote:

> "Notwithstanding their many promises to us about quick and effective processing of the 60+ devices they seized, the FBI is completely fucking us on this."

**([EFTA00009802](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00009802.pdf))**

The specific failures catalogued in this email chain include:

**Disconnected email-attachment linkage:**
> "The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, 'see the attached flight records,' for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves."

**Missing native file links:**
> "The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the native files show up in the database."

**Mismatched control numbers:**
> "The control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of numbers and no way to match up anything."

**([EFTA00009802](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00009802.pdf))**

### The FBI's Response

The FBI CART coordinator pushed back on the USAO's characterization:

> "Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or its contractors) are not 'processing' anything. You are taking files that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) to do a taint review. Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few."

> "Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have gotten past encryption on multiple devices."

**([EFTA00016425](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016425.pdf))**

## 4.3 The 71,000 Zero-Byte Files

When the first batch of seven devices was finally delivered, approximately 71,000 files were empty -- zero bytes. The FBI CART examiner stated this was "not unusual for the software to find such files," but the sheer volume raises the question: were these genuine extraction artifacts, or evidence of prior deletion? **([EFTA00032065](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00032065.pdf))**

**What was not done:** No forensic determination was made as to whether the zero-byte files represented actual data loss, intentional deletion, or software artifacts.

## 4.4 The Failed Server Drives

Two servers from the USVI seizure had physically failed hard drives. They were sent to FBI HQ for specialized recovery. The examiner warned:

> "Since they are physically broken, data recovery may or may not be possible. It can be a very long process."

**([EFTA00032065](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00032065.pdf))**

**What was not done:** The outcome of this recovery effort is not documented in the available file production. Whether the server data was ever recovered remains unknown.

## 4.5 The Six Unfinished Machine Exports

As of October 2020, the FBI CART coordinator stated:

> "All the additional exports with the exception of 6 machines have been completed."

**([EFTA00037676](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037676.pdf))**

**What was not done:** The status of these six machines is never resolved in the available record.

## 4.6 The VHS Surveillance Tapes -- Never Scanned

Maxell T-160 time-lapse surveillance VHS tapes, seized from Epstein's Palm Beach residence, were logged into evidence but annotated "ITEM WAS NOT SCANNED." **([EFTA00007741](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00007741.pdf), [EFTA00007984](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00007984.pdf), [EFTA00007987](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00007987.pdf), [EFTA00007990](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00007990.pdf))** These tapes were specifically formatted for surveillance use -- "Ideal for use in Time Lapse Recording" is printed on each tape. **([EFTA00007984](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00007984.pdf), [EFTA01721063](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01721063.pdf))**

Internal FBI discussions noted: "should take the vhs tapes." **([EFTA00023673](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00023673.pdf), [EFTA00023957](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00023957.pdf))** But the record does not indicate they were ever viewed.

**What was not done:** Time-lapse surveillance tapes from a sex offender's residence, seized pursuant to a valid warrant, were never played back. Their contents remain unknown.

## 4.7 The Bannon-Epstein Evidence

During a review of Steve Bannon's iPhone 7 in the "We Build the Wall" (WBTW) case, an FBI reviewer found two categories of Epstein-relevant evidence:

**The Trump-Maxwell Photograph:**

> "Hope you're well! I'm helping out with the responsiveness review for WBTW..."

The reviewer found an image of Trump and Ghislaine Maxwell on Bannon's phone and flagged it to the Epstein/Maxwell case team. The response from the SDNY prosecutor:

> "Thanks very much for flagging -- no need to do anything with this one, but thanks for letting me know, and do let me know if anything else pops up."

**([EFTA00025553](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00025553.pdf))**

**The Bannon-Epstein Text Messages:**

Additionally, the review revealed a "number of text messages between Steve Bannon and Jeffrey Epstein" on Bannon's phone. These were classified as "not responsive to our warrant." **([EFTA00027290](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027290.pdf))**

**What was not done:** The Bannon-Epstein texts were never reviewed by the Epstein case team. No separate warrant was sought. The relationship between Bannon and Epstein was extensive and documented (Apple Watch gift January 2019 **([EFTA02271437](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02271437.pdf))**, Epstein brokered Bannon-Barak meeting February 2019 **([EFTA02633609](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02633609.pdf))**, Bannon on Epstein's island January 2019 **([EFTA02273951](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02273951.pdf))**), but the text messages that could have illuminated it were never reviewed by the Epstein case team, and no separate warrant was sought.

# CHAPTER 5: AUGUST 10, 2019 -- THE DEATH

## 5.1 The Suicide Watch Failure

Epstein was found unresponsive after a prior suicide attempt on July 23, 2019. He was placed on suicide watch. **([EFTA00019348](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019348.pdf))** The BOP's suicide watch protocol generated extensive email traffic:

- July 23, 2019: "Placed on Suicide Watch... Follow-up in 24 Hours" **([EFTA00019348](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00019348.pdf), [EFTA00034232](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00034232.pdf))**
- July 27, 2019: Update forwarded to BOP officials **([EFTA00035313](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00035313.pdf))**
- July 30, 2019: "Inmate Epstein #76318-054 is being t... appropriate cellmate." **([EFTA00032148](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00032148.pdf))**

Epstein was removed from suicide watch after approximately 6 days at the direction of the Chief Psychologist. **([EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf))** He was transferred to the Special Housing Unit and given a cellmate, Efrain Reyes. His cellmate was subsequently transferred out, leaving Epstein alone on the night of August 9-10, 2019.

## 5.2 The DVR Catastrophe

The Metropolitan Correctional Center operated a surveillance system comprising:
- **192 total cameras**, 128 assigned to recording
- **DVR 1:** 16 hard drives, operational, recorded data from 7/23 to 8/10/2019. **2 camera angles** of interest recorded to DVR 1.
- **DVR 2:** 16 hard drives. **3 of 4 camera angles of interest in the SHU** -- including the sally port camera (elevator banks #1 and #2) -- recorded to DVR 2.

**([EFTA01649190](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01649190.pdf))**

### The Timeline of DVR 2 Failure

| Date | Event | Source |
|------|-------|--------|
| Sept 2018 | BOP awards contracts to NiceVision and Company 2 for camera upgrade | [EFTA00039025](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00039025.pdf) |

| July 30, 2019 | Epstein transferred back to SHU -- the area primarily monitored by DVR 2 | [EFTA00032148](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00032148.pdf) |
| Aug 8, 2019 | DVR 2 recording failure **first detected** by MCC staff; 2 additional hard drives fail | [EFTA01649190](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01649190.pdf) |

| Aug 14, 2019 | FBI CART/MXU downloads priority cameras from DVR 1; password obtained | [EFTA00017948](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00017948.pdf)-49 |

### The Quantico Analysis

The FBI's Digital Forensics Analysis Unit at Quantico attempted to recover DVR 2:

> "DVR 2 did not start successfully. The Digital Forensics Analysis Unit found that the system contained three faulty hard drives. The FBI forensic reports state that the three drives were repaired by an FBI Advanced Data Recovery Specialist, but the DVR was never able to be assembled successfully. The forensic reports further state that an FBI computer scientist and the Company 1 Technician reviewed the DVR 2 controller logs and found that there had previously been 'catastrophic disk failures' and no recordings would have been available after July 29, 2019."

**([EFTA00039025](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00039025.pdf) -- OIG Report)**

The seized DVR 2 hard drives were individually catalogued:

| NYCO Number | Description | Serial Number |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| NYC023578 | Seagate Barracuda 500GB | Z3T6CJJA |
| NYC023579 | Hitachi 500GB | JP1572JE36A13K |
| NYC023580 | Seagate Barracuda 500GB | Z3T6CFSX |
| NYC023582 | Hitachi 500GB | JP1572JE36MWNK |
| NYC023583 | Seagate Barracuda 500GB | 9QMBEC75 |

**([EFTA00023970](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00023970.pdf)-75)**

Image analysis of the physical evidence shows the hard drives were photographed and labeled:
- "DVR 2 DISK ARRAY Clone #9" **([EFTA00008432](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%205/EFTA00008432.pdf))**
- "Master Copy: Archive of DVR Main Controller Images" **([EFTA00008468](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%205/EFTA00008468.pdf))**
- "Master Copy: Archive of DVR 2 Controller images, DVR 2 repaired drive images, and Video Exports" **([EFTA00008472](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%205/EFTA00008472.pdf))**

**Result: Three of four cameras covering the SHU where Epstein died had NO recoverable recordings from after July 29, 2019 -- 12 days before his death.**

**What was not done:** No investigation into why replacement hard drives obtained on August 9 were never installed. No determination of whether the DVR 2 failure was mechanical or deliberate. No accountability for the fact that the most sensitive inmate in federal custody was housed in an area where 75% of the surveillance cameras were non-functional.

## 5.3 The 4chan Leak

On the day of Epstein's death, images from MCC appeared on 4chan before official notification. The FBI captured at least 8 screenshots from the 4chan thread. **([EFTA01731021](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01731021.pdf))** The source posted from a dynamic IP address that was never identified. FBI case file materials include "4chan8 PNG" entries. **([EFTA01731021](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01731021.pdf))**

The BOP's own incident chronology recorded: "10:15 pm: Computer Services Manager arrives at institution to remove hard drives (Computers) from SHU. And replaced with new ones." This occurred on the evening of August 10, 2019 -- approximately 16 hours after Epstein's body was found that morning. The Computer Services Manager departed at 12:15 AM on August 11. **([EFTA00033799](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00033799.pdf), [EFTA00035175](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00035175.pdf))**

**What was not done:** The 4chan leaker was never identified. No final report on these anomalies was ever issued.

## 5.4 The Guard DPAs and Dismissal

Two correctional officers -- CO Michael Thomas and CO Tova Noel -- were responsible for guarding Epstein on the night of his death. The FBI master briefing documented:

> "CO Michael Thomas was working... suicide."
> "5 times inmate head count was not conducted."
> "43 Interviews conducted: 28 MCC Staff Members (AG was present), 15 Inmates total most from SHU."

**([EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf))**

The guards were initially charged with conspiracy and making false records. They entered into deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs):

> "The guards have agreed to a deferred prosecution agreement."

**([EFTA00028709](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00028709.pdf))**

A judge subsequently approved the DPA, and the charges were dismissed after the terms were satisfied. **([EFTA00025231](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00025231.pdf))**

Separately, the DOJ Inspector General investigated additional BOP employees for false certifications related to Epstein's death:

> "It was determined that the USAO SDNY would not prosecute" Lieutenant [REDACTED], Material Handler Supervisor [REDACTED], or Correctional Officer Tova Noel.

**([EFTA00035812](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00035812.pdf), September 2021)**

**What was not done:** No one was held criminally responsible for the conditions that enabled Epstein's death. The guards received community service. The Lieutenant and Material Handler Supervisor identified by OIG were declined for prosecution by SDNY.

## 5.5 The Autopsy

The OCME autopsy documented hyoid bone fracture to the left great horn and fractures to left and right superior horns of the thyroid. **([EFTA01684283](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01684283.pdf), pp. 14-16)** The manner of death was ruled suicide by hanging.

The FBI master timeline document states:

> "Case closed 12/5/2022, with no criminality found. OCME autopsy report stated cause of death was hanging and the manner of death was suicide."

**([EFTA01656152](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656152.pdf), [EFTA01656173](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656173.pdf), [EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf))**

## 5.6 No Final Report

As of this date, no comprehensive final FBI or OIG report on the circumstances of Epstein's death has been publicly issued. SDNY's own prosecutors had difficulty even obtaining the OIG's internal report:

> "We were hoping you could assist us with getting in touch with the OIG lawyer who is responsible for preparing the report on Epstein's suicide. We have been trying to get in touch with [REDACTED] who was previously handling the investigation, but understand he may have left the office."

**([EFTA00024810](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024810.pdf), [EFTA00028580](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00028580.pdf), [EFTA00028699](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00028699.pdf), May 21, 2021)**

Multiple iterations of this request appear in the file -- the OIG investigator had apparently departed. **([EFTA00028709](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00028709.pdf), [EFTA00029187](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00029187.pdf))**

**What was not done:** The death investigation (90A case) was closed on December 5, 2022, "with no criminality found." No final public report was ever issued explaining the DVR failures, the guard misconduct, the 4chan leak, the hard drive movements, or the failure to maintain suicide watch.

# CHAPTER 6: 2019-2024 -- THE AFTERMATH

## 6.1 The Maxwell Prosecution -- Narrowing the Lens

On June 29, 2020, Ghislaine Maxwell was indicted. On July 2, 2020, she was arrested in New Hampshire. **([EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf))**

The prosecution was deliberately narrowed:

- The Maxwell prosecution memorandum stated: "Cooperating Defendants: None currently and none expected." **([EFTA02731168](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731168.pdf), Page 26)**
- The discovery section acknowledged: "we have not received most of the materials seized in July and August of 2019, which comprise many terabytes of data." **([EFTA02731168](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731168.pdf), Page 26)**
- The prosecution excluded the most prominent accusers and the most powerful alleged abusers. A journalist noted the contradiction: Maxwell's "most prominent public accuser, [REDACTED], not being part of this case; no charges based on her allegations and not expected to be a witness for Gov." SDNY responded: "no comment." **([EFTA00014713](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00014713.pdf), [EFTA00021049](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021049.pdf))**

Maxwell was convicted on December 30, 2021 and sentenced to 20 years. **([EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf))**

She remains the only person ever convicted in the Epstein case.

## 6.2 The Co-Conspirator Plea That Never Happened

The SDNY pursued plea negotiations with at least one additional co-conspirator who "scheduled hundreds of sexual massages with minors for Epstein." Internal debates were intense:

> "She thinks it's a close call between making [REDACTED] take 2 felony plea and declining to prosecute, but she ultimately comes down in favor of a felony plea. She does not think we should charge [REDACTED] with sex trafficking."

**([EFTA00024285](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024285.pdf), [EFTA00016245](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016245.pdf))**

The Human Trafficking Coordinators wrote:

> "Our Office ordinarily would decline to prosecute a victim-participant like [REDACTED] absent certain aggravating factors... Because those aggravating factors are not present here, the Coordinators believe it is a very close call."

**([EFTA00016245](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016245.pdf))**

A supervisor noted the "change in our views of [REDACTED's] obstructive conduct (particularly with respect to destruction of materials)" and suggested highlighting "just the large number of underage victims." **([EFTA00016245](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00016245.pdf))**

**What was not done:** No public charges were ever filed against any co-conspirator other than Maxwell. The plea negotiations appear to have collapsed or been abandoned.

## 6.3 The Named Individuals Who Were Never Charged

The FBI's own master briefing document ([EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf), pages 17-18) contained sexual abuse allegations against multiple named prominent individuals. The SDNY's internal files show these individuals were identified, assessed, and then not pursued:

### Prince Andrew
SDNY filed an MLAT request to the UK acknowledging "evidence that Prince Andrew engaged in sexual conduct involving one of Epstein's victims" but stated he was "not presently a target." **([EFTA00022062](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022062.pdf))** Months of negotiations with his lawyer Gary Bloxsome at Blackfords LLP yielded nothing. Andrew refused cooperation. SDNY stated it would seek a "compelled interview" **([EFTA00010321](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00010321.pdf))** but the MLAT process was never completed. Andrew settled Virginia Giuffre's civil lawsuit. **No charges were ever filed.**

### Leon Black
At least four victims named Black. FBI 302 interviews were conducted. Black paid $62.5 million to USVI in civil settlement. **([EFTA02731473](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731473.pdf), [EFTA02731484](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731484.pdf))** A victim's attorney wrote SDNY: "It's outrageous that criminal charges have not been brought against him. I've heard one lawyer represents ten women that he sexually assaulted." **([EFTA02731473](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731473.pdf))** SDNY's Civil Rights Unit concluded: "There does not appear to be any evidence of overlap with Maxwell other than the allegations of the victim in DANY's open investigation of Black and CRU doesn't intend to open anything separate based on current information." **([EFTA02731660](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731660.pdf))** **No charges were ever filed.**

### Jes Staley
An SDNY prosecutor flagged: "one of the non/minor Epstein victims alleges that Jes Staley raped her during a massage." **([EFTA00029358](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00029358.pdf))** Email evidence showed Staley requesting women from Epstein: "Is she free tonight?" **([EFTA00029429](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00029429.pdf)-34)** SDNY coordinated with the UK FCA but requested they "not go overt anytime soon." **([EFTA00022164](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022164.pdf))** **No charges were ever filed in any jurisdiction.**

### Bill Richardson
A victim testified under oath that she was "ordered to" have sex with Richardson. An SDNY prosecutor classified him as effectively a "subject." A senior prosecutor reacted: "This is so, so frustrating." **([EFTA00014372](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00014372.pdf), [EFTA00014374](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00014374.pdf))** Richardson's counsel presented blanket denials. Richardson later said in a May 2021 videoconference: "Never met any women through JE or GM" -- directly contradicting sworn victim testimony. **([EFTA00024683](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00024683.pdf))** **Richardson was never subpoenaed or compelled to testify. He died in September 2023. No charges were ever filed.**

### Glenn and Eva Dubin
A victim used the term "lent out" to describe being directed by Maxwell or Epstein to have sexual contact with Glenn Dubin. **([EFTA02731082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731082.pdf))** 54 documents reference the Dubins in the database. **No investigation or charges were ever pursued.**

### Others
The FBI Prominent Names briefing **([EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf))** contained allegations against additional individuals, most of whom were never investigated, subpoenaed, or charged. The NTOC tips system received 291 total tips (52 anonymous), of which only 27 of 239 followed-up tips resulted in secondary contact. **([EFTA01660651](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660651.pdf), [EFTA01660679](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660679.pdf), [EFTA00164939](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00164939.pdf))** At least 12 individuals named in victim testimony escaped criminal accountability. Three -- the Alexander brothers (Alon, Oren, and Tal) -- are now on trial at SDNY (January 2026) for sex trafficking of 60+ women, though their charges arose from a separate investigation.

## 6.4 AG Barr's Selective Recusal

On July 9, 2019, Attorney General William Barr announced his recusal decisions:

> Barr "consulted with career ethics officials at the department, and concluded he did not have to recuse himself from the current prosecution in Manhattan."

However, Barr did recuse himself from "the retrospective review" of the Florida NPA because Kirkland & Ellis, which he joined in 2009, had represented Epstein. **([EFTA00018398](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00018398.pdf))**

This created a structural conflict: the Attorney General who maintained oversight of the active prosecution had former institutional ties to the firm that negotiated the original immunity deal. The Southern District of Florida was separately "ordered recused by DOJ." **([EFTA00028149](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00028149.pdf))**

Additionally, an NTOC tip stated: "Barr and Black were present during abuses" and a victim "stated she was at Epstein's for a model event and ran into Barr who stated he wanted to see her next time he came." **([EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf))**

**What was not done:** No independent review of whether Barr's split recusal was adequate. No investigation into the NTOC allegations against Barr himself.

## 6.5 CSAM Found in 2023 -- Three Years Late

During estate settlement proceedings in 2023, child sexual abuse material was discovered on Epstein's devices -- material that had been missed during the entire 2019-2021 evidence processing effort:

**([EFTA00039019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00039019.pdf))**

The FBI's own 2024 summary acknowledged: "small number of CSAM images found on one of Epstein's devices." **([EFTA00038617](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038617.pdf))**

**What was not done:** CSAM was present on seized devices for three to four years without detection. This material was found by estate attorneys, not law enforcement -- despite the FBI having processed the same devices. The discovery raises fundamental questions about the thoroughness of the original forensic examination.

## 6.6 Jean-Luc Brunel -- Death Before Trial

Jean-Luc Brunel was arrested in France in December 2020 after SDNY coordinated with French investigating judges:

> "There are three investigating judges assigned to this case, which is pretty unusual... and suggests its importance for them."

**([EFTA00021720](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021720.pdf))**

France demanded reciprocity: "they are not going to help SDNY unless we show a good faith effort to help them, and begin sending evidence their way." **([EFTA00021720](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021720.pdf))**

Brunel was found dead in his Paris jail cell on February 19, 2022, in an apparent suicide. He was never tried. Both men whose criminal proceedings could have compelled testimony against others died in custody.

## 6.7 The Evidence Still in Boxes

As of October 2020, the FBI's own scanning operation of Florida case records was ongoing. When the SDNY needed materials:

> "We have finished scanning! In the course of going through the paper it was discovered that at some point in time (perhaps between 2013 and 2015 when it was last digitized) three 1As failed to make it back into their respective file jackets. It's not clear what happened or who is at fault."

**([EFTA00013245](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00013245.pdf), [EFTA00013261](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00013261.pdf))**

The FBI maintained that all digital evidence was "available through our CAIR system for over a year" **([EFTA00037676](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037676.pdf))** -- but availability and examination are not the same thing. The 2023 CSAM discovery proved that evidence available through CAIR had not been thoroughly examined.

# CHAPTER 7: WHAT WAS NEVER DONE

This chapter catalogues every significant investigative step that should have been taken but was not.

## 7.1 Evidence That Was Never Examined

1. **The 2005 Palm Beach Computer** (16 EnCase DVDs) -- Never searched. No warrant sought. Estate refused privilege waiver. **([EFTA00015823](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00015823.pdf))**

2. **Maxell T-160 VHS Surveillance Tapes** -- Seized, catalogued as "ITEM WAS NOT SCANNED," never played. **([EFTA00007741](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00007741.pdf), [EFTA00007984](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00007984.pdf), [EFTA00007987](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00007987.pdf), [EFTA00007990](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%204/EFTA00007990.pdf))**

3. **Bannon-Epstein Text Messages** -- Found on Bannon's iPhone 7, classified as "not responsive to our warrant," never reviewed by Epstein case team. **([EFTA00027290](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027290.pdf))**

4. **Trump-Maxwell Photo on Bannon Phone** -- Flagged by reviewer, dismissed with "no need to do anything with this one." **([EFTA00025553](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00025553.pdf))**

5. **71,000 Zero-Byte Files** -- Never forensically determined to represent data loss, deletion, or software artifacts. **([EFTA00032065](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00032065.pdf))**

6. **6+ Machines Still Unexported** as of October 2020 -- Status never resolved. **([EFTA00037676](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037676.pdf))**

7. **2 Server Drives with Physical Failure** -- Sent to FBI HQ for recovery; outcome not documented. **([EFTA00032065](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00032065.pdf))**

8. **CSAM That Was Not Found Until 2023** -- Present on devices for 3-4 years without detection. **([EFTA00039019](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00039019.pdf), [EFTA00038617](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00038617.pdf))**

9. **Disconnected Email Attachments** -- Emails referencing "attached flight records" could not be linked to their attachments in the 1.1 million document production. **([EFTA00009802](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00009802.pdf))**

10. **NYCO24342 -- Empty Device** -- Device folders completely empty; no determination whether genuine or extraction failure. **([EFTA00020213](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020213.pdf))**

11. **NYCO27913 -- Missing from Disc** -- Listed as provided 7/23 but physically absent from delivered disc. **([EFTA00020213](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020213.pdf))**

12. **The 99-Day PLIST Metadata Gap** (Nov 14, 2018 - Feb 21, 2019) -- A gap in Apple Mail PLIST metadata from DS11 was not cross-referenced against the DS9 email corpus, which contains continuous daily email activity throughout this period. The gap is an extraction artifact, not actual email silence.

## 7.2 People Who Were Never Charged

| Individual | Evidence in FBI Files | Action Taken | Result |
|------------|---------------------|--------------|--------|
| Alan Dershowitz | Multiple victim testimony (2014+); member of defense team that negotiated NPA with co-conspirator immunity clause | None | Never investigated |

| Eva Dubin | Long-term facilitator role | None documented | Never investigated |
| Sarah Kellen / redacted co-conspirator | DAG memo: one redacted person "scheduled hundreds of sexual massages with minors" and was "also a victim"; plea draft evidence ([EFTA00089268](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00089268.pdf)) matches Kellen | Plea negotiations for obstruction | Collapsed; no charges **([EFTA00013209](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00013209.pdf))** |
| Nadia Marcinkova | Named NPA co-conspirator; $100K post-Herald wire | Protected by NPA immunity | No charges |

| BOP employees (death) | False certifications, false statements | OIG investigation | SDNY declined **([EFTA00035812](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00035812.pdf))** |
| Guards (Thomas/Noel) | Failed to conduct rounds; falsified records | Charged; DPA offered | Charges dismissed **([EFTA00025231](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00025231.pdf))** |
| Darren Indyke | Told witness "not to talk to police" | None | Never investigated **([EFTA02731082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731082.pdf))** |
| CBP Officer (Badge #CAS03223) | Self-incriminated: "Everyone knew I was friends with Epstein"; Agriculture specialist at STT; DS9 contains unredacted identification | FBI proffer sessions Oct-Nov 2020 | Outcome unknown **([EFTA00031495](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00031495.pdf))** |

## 7.3 Investigations That Were Never Opened or Were Prematurely Closed

1. **No investigation of Dershowitz's dual role** as defense attorney and alleged co-conspirator in NPA negotiations.

2. **No investigation of work-release conditions** -- computer brought to jail, sexual contact during transport, guard complicity. **([EFTA02731082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731082.pdf))**

3. **No investigation of evidence destruction** -- computer removal before Palm Beach search, directory shredding at Maxwell's house. **([EFTA02731082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731082.pdf))**

4. **No cross-referencing of the 99-day PLIST metadata gap** (an extraction artifact in DS11) against the DS9 email corpus that shows continuous activity, in the context of the documented pattern of evidence destruction.

5. **No investigation of Indyke's instruction** to a witness "not to talk to police." **([EFTA02731082](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731082.pdf))**

6. **No investigation of post-Herald payments** ($350,000 to associates/co-conspirators within 5 days of publication) as witness tampering. **([EFTA00020685](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020685.pdf))**

7. **No investigation of surveillance tip** (Epstein with young girl on Palm Beach bike paths, late 2018/early 2019) -- "nothing was done." **([EFTA00020778](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020778.pdf))**

8. **Death investigation closed 12/5/2022** "with no criminality found" despite unresolved questions about DVR failures, hard drive movements, and 4chan leak. **([EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf))**

9. **OPR investigation of NPA** -- opened February 2019, no public consequence.

10. **No final FBI or OIG report** ever issued on the death investigation.

## 7.4 Structural Failures

1. **No single authority maintained comprehensive responsibility.** The case was fragmented across SDFL, SDNY, DANY (Manhattan DA), UK FCA, French investigating judges, USVI, OPR, and OIG. **([EFTA00021720](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021720.pdf), [EFTA00022164](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00022164.pdf))**

2. **No standardized evidence tracking.** Prosecutors created their own spreadsheets because the FBI had no system: "it's basically impossible for us to keep track." **([EFTA00009802](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00009802.pdf))**

3. **No adequate forensic staffing.** A single CART examiner was reduced to 1 day per week during COVID, stretching processing by "a factor of 5." **([EFTA00009941](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00009941.pdf))**

4. **No victim-centered investigation.** Victim notification letters deliberately omitted CVRA references because "other DOJ components are currently litigating whether the CVRA applies in the context of a pre-indictment plea." **([EFTA00027440](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00027440.pdf))**

5. **Every prosecution was narrowed, never expanded.** The 2008 investigation was narrowed from federal indictment to state plea. The 2019 investigation was narrowed from dozens of co-conspirators to Epstein alone. The 2020 Maxwell indictment was narrowed to specific victims and time periods. The Leon Black investigation was deferred to DANY and abandoned. **([EFTA00013209](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00013209.pdf), [EFTA02731660](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731660.pdf))**

6. **Both individuals whose proceedings could have compelled testimony about others died in custody.** Epstein (August 10, 2019) and Brunel (February 19, 2022). **([EFTA01660622](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660622.pdf), [EFTA00021720](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00021720.pdf))**

# CONCLUSION: THE CUMULATIVE WEIGHT

The Jeffrey Epstein case represents not a single failure but a cascading series of institutional choices, each of which compounded the last. When mapped chronologically, the pattern is unmistakable:

**1996-2005:** FBI had source reporting on Epstein but opened no investigation for a decade. Palm Beach PD seized a computer and surveillance tapes that were never examined.

**2007-2008:** Federal prosecutors negotiated a deal that immunized unnamed co-conspirators; one member of the defense team, Dershowitz, was later accused by multiple victims (beginning in 2014) of being a participant in the abuse. Victims were deliberately deceived. The DAG's office found federal prosecution "appropriate" but deferred to a state plea.

**2008-2019:** Epstein continued operating his trafficking network for eleven years after the NPA. Tips were ignored. The SDNY finally opened an investigation in response to journalism, not law enforcement intelligence.

**July-August 2019:** 70+ devices were seized but processing was crippled by understaffing, inadequate tools, and inter-agency dysfunction. The FBI was "completely fucking" the prosecutors. Evidence remained in limbo for 17 months.

**August 10, 2019:** The most important defendant in the case died in a facility where 75% of the relevant surveillance cameras were non-functional, guards were not conducting rounds, and no final investigation report would ever be issued.

**2019-2024:** The Maxwell prosecution was deliberately narrowed. Co-conspirator plea negotiations collapsed. Named abusers with evidence in FBI files were never charged. CSAM was found on devices three years after seizure. The death investigation was closed "with no criminality found."

At every step, the trajectory was the same: narrow the investigation, limit the exposure, close the case. Not a single person in Epstein's orbit, other than Maxwell, was ever held criminally accountable. Not a single institutional actor -- not the prosecutors who concealed the NPA, not the guards who failed to conduct rounds, not the officials who oversaw the DVR disaster -- faced meaningful consequences.

The evidence handling failures alone are staggering: an unsearched 2005 computer, VHS surveillance tapes never played, 71,000 zero-byte files never explained, server drives lost to physical failure, six machines never exported, CSAM missed for years, text messages classified as "not responsive," and a PLIST metadata gap never cross-referenced against the actual email corpus. Each of these failures, taken individually, might be explained by resource constraints, technical limitations, or procedural requirements. Taken together, they describe an institution that systematically failed to look at the evidence it possessed.

This is the story of how the United States Department of Justice, across two decades, four administrations, and multiple offices, proved incapable of dismantling a sex trafficking operation that it knew about, had evidence about, and chose, at every critical juncture, not to fully investigate.

The question is not whether there were failures. The question is whether the failures were this consistent by accident.

*This narrative was compiled from exhaustive search of 3.5 million+ redaction records, 38,955 OCR records, and 27,231 analyzed images across four forensic databases.

The pattern documented here is not one of individual errors but of systematic institutional failure at every level of the American justice system.*
