## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

After exhaustive analysis of all hidden text, extracted entities, and reconstructed financial pages in the DOJ Epstein file database, **no legitimate source sufficient to explain $500M+ in wealth has been identified in these documents**. The records reveal:

1. **Massive portfolio balances** across multiple Deutsche Bank accounts totaling $100M-$130M (at Institution-1/DB alone)
2. **An additional $40-50M** held in "The Haze Trust" at DB
3. **Investment income of approximately $3.5-4M/year** from fixed-income portfolios -- insufficient to build $500M from scratch
4. **No identified clients, investors, or management fee income** in any financial document
5. **The only named source** in the entire corpus: Leslie Wexner, referenced repeatedly as "[he] earned his money from Wexner"
6. **An elaborate web of shell entities** all managed by the same two Deutsche Bank officers (Jj Litchford / Paul Morris and later Morris/Oldfield)
7. **Active KYC compliance breaches** flagged by Deutsche Bank's own compliance teams for Southern Financial LLC
8. **Evidence of potential witness tampering** via $100K and $250K wire transfers to NPA co-conspirators days after the NPA was published

**REVISIT UPDATES (2026-02-12, DS9/DS11):** The following findings substantially expand this report:
- **Total documented wealth now precisely quantified:** $319.5M as of June 2013 ([EFTA02678941](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02678941.pdf), DS11) and $159M across top 3 entities alone as of October 2015 ([EFTA02671293](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02671293.pdf), DS11) -- both significantly exceeding the original estimates
- **Wexner "seed money" mechanism confirmed** by DOJ psychological assessment: POA-enabled misappropriation of $46M+ ([EFTA00105651](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00105651.pdf), DS9)
- **Leon Black fee structure documented:** Epstein as tax architect claiming $600M in savings, fee dispute letters, $50-60M expected fees ([EFTA02475850](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02475850.pdf), DS11)
- **Paul Barrett identified** as professional portfolio manager who left $1.5M/year JPMorgan career for Epstein ([EFTA02619039](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02619039.pdf), DS11)
- **LGT Bank Liechtenstein** actively pursued as replacement bank in March 2019 with instructions to conceal Epstein's identity ([EFTA02638188](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02638188.pdf), DS11)
- **Alfa Bank (Russia)** wire transfers documented January-February 2019 ([EFTA02627228](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02627228.pdf), DS11)
- **Unanswered Questions #1, #2, #4, and #7 now answered** -- see addendum below

**Central Finding:** These documents contain hundreds of millions in documented asset balances but virtually no trail showing where those assets originated. The absence is itself the most significant forensic finding.

## I. THE BAIL MEMO: THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN ASSESSMENT ([EFTA00028785](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00028785.pdf))

The government's bail memorandum provides the foundational claim:

### A. The $500M+ Figure
> *"is extravagantly wealthy and worth, according to records relating to the defendant recently obtained by the Government from a financial institution ('Institution-1'), more than $500 million."*
> -- [EFTA00028785](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00028785.pdf), Page 3, Confidence: 0.99

### B. The $10M/Year Overseas Transfers
> *"He already earns at least... $10,000,000 per year, according to records from Institution-1... Islands traveling extensively abroad and residing in part in Paris"*
> -- [EFTA00028785](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00028785.pdf), Page 4, Confidence: 0.99

### C. Witness Tampering Wires
> *"Records obtained by the Government from Institution-1 appear to show that just two days later, on or about November 30, 2018, the defendant wired $100,000 from a trust account he controlled to an individual named as a possible co-conspirator in the NPA. The same records appear to show that just three days after that, on or about December 3, 2018, the defendant wired $250,000 from the same trust account to another"*
> -- [EFTA00028785](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00028785.pdf), Page 10, Confidence: 0.99

**Analysis:** "Institution-1" is Deutsche Bank. The bail memo establishes the scale of wealth but critically does NOT explain its source. The government itself appears not to have identified a legitimate origin.

## II. DOCUMENTED ACCOUNT BALANCES -- WHAT WAS THERE

### A. Deutsche Bank Portfolio Accounts (EFTA01288xxx-01291xxx Range)

These DB portfolio statements reveal staggering balances across multiple accounts:

| EFTA Number | Account Value Range | Estimated Annual Income |
|---|---|---|
| [EFTA01288772](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01288772.pdf) | $103M - $132M | $3.7M - $6.4M |
| [EFTA01288997](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01288997.pdf) | $102M - $117M | $2.5M - $5.7M |
| [EFTA01288520](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01288520.pdf) | $103M - $128M | $3.6M - $3.9M |
| [EFTA01288458](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01288458.pdf) | $64M - $90M | $3.2M - $3.7M |
| [EFTA01290724](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01290724.pdf) | $63M - $63.6M | $0.03M - $0.25M |
| [EFTA01290854](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01290854.pdf) | $34M - $47.7M | $0.08M - $0.17M |
| [EFTA01290128](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01290128.pdf) | $26M - $40M | $0.07M - $0.08M |
| [EFTA01289887](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01289887.pdf) | $7.7M - $8.2M | $0.006M - $0.1M |
| [EFTA01290231](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01290231.pdf) | $3.1M - $7.1M | $0.07M - $0.08M |
| [EFTA01291697](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01291697.pdf) | $3.1M - $4.9M | $0.01M - $0.04M |

**Key Observation:** The largest single account ([EFTA01288772](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01288772.pdf)) fluctuated between $103M and $132M. Annual investment income ranged from $3.3M to $6.4M -- entirely consistent with coupon/interest payments on a fixed-income portfolio, NOT with fund management fees.

### B. The Haze Trust -- The Largest Single Entity

The Haze Trust held the largest documented balances at Deutsche Bank:

- **Maximum observed balance: $49,460,098.13** ([EFTA01381246](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01381246.pdf), dated 06/21/18)
- Also observed at: $49,397,167.47; $49,336,341.83; $49,233,909.70
- A separate Haze Trust account showed: $12,690,279.36 and $21,077,720.73
- At one point: $40,583,100.79

**The Haze Trust, at peak, held approximately $49.5M in a single DB account, with additional accounts potentially totaling $60M+.**

### C. JPMorgan Chase Accounts (EFTA01482xxx-01504xxx)

Chase/JPM bank statements show:
- **Primary Account holder: JEFFREY E EPSTEIN** ([EFTA01482271](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01482271.pdf))
- Fedwire debits to: FirstBank PR (Puerto Rico entities), multiple payees
- One statement shows: **Total Credits: $9,200,000.00 / Total Debits: $0.00** ([EFTA01504498](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01504498.pdf)) -- a massive single-period inflow with no outflows
- JPM Custody account ([EFTA01583420](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01583420.pdf)): Asset account with "DO NOT REPAT" (Do Not Repatriate) code

### D. TD Ameritrade Portfolio ([EFTA01267639](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01267639.pdf))

557+ pages of TD Ameritrade account statements showing:
- Account Positions with Symbol, Market Value, Purchase Cost, Unrealized Gains
- Insured Deposit Account Interest Credits
- Statement of Financial Condition data

This is a brokerage account with traded securities positions, not a managed fund.

## III. THE SHELL ENTITY NETWORK

### A. Deutsche Bank "Large, Zero and Negative Balances" Reports

The RM Code 82289 reports (multiple dates in 2018) reveal ALL entities under the same relationship manager:

| Entity Name | Category | Sample Balance |
|---|---|---|
| JEFFREY EPSTEIN | N | $1.2M - $4.4M |
| SOUTHERN FINANCIAL LLC | D | $276K - $7M |
| SOUTHERN TRUST COMPANY, INC. | M | $245K - $17M |
| THE HAZE TRUST | D | $2.5M - $49.5M |
| BUTTERFLY TRUST | M | $705K - $734K |
| GRATITUDE AMERICA, LTD | N/M | $106K - $4.3M |
| ZORRO MANAGEMENT, LLC | D/O | $118K - $424K |
| HYPERION AIR, LLC | D | $147K - $348K |
| PLAN D, LLC | D/O | $218K - $790K |
| JEGE, LLC (also JEGE, INC) | D | $240K - $463K |
| NES, LLC | D | $114K - $264K |
| NEPTUNE, LLC | D | $276K - $367K |
| DARREN K. INDYKE PLLC | D/M | $117K - $440K |
| HBRK ASSOCIATES, INC | D | $149K - $419K |
| LSJE, LLC | D | $172K - $502K |

**Categories: N = Normal, D = Deficit/Debit, M = Management, O = Overdraft**

### B. The Banker Assignment List ([EFTA01477454](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01477454.pdf))

A critical document shows ALL accounts under the same DB Private Wealth Management bankers (Morris/Oldfield):

- JEFFREY EPSTEIN
- SOUTHERN FINANCIAL LLC
- GRATITUDE AMERICA LTD
- CRW 2007 LLC
- NEW YORK STRATEGY GROUP
- **LEON D. BLACK** (appears TWICE)
- PLAN D LLC
- MARK F. DZIALGA
- JEGE INC
- THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION [OF]...
- DOMINIQUE LEIMER
- 55W 2007 LLC
- HBRK ASSOCIATES
- KATI FORSYTHE 2014 TRUST
- SHARI WAGNER 2014 TRUST
- WANEK TRUST OF 2000
- JSC INTERIORS LLC

**CRITICAL FINDING:** Leon D. Black -- the billionaire co-founder of Apollo Global Management -- had his personal accounts at Deutsche Bank managed by THE SAME banker team (Morris/Oldfield) that managed all of Epstein's entities. This is not a coincidence; this is a direct financial relationship facilitated by the same bank officers.

### C. The Complete DB Account Officer List ([EFTA01359500](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01359500.pdf))

An even more detailed account list shows:

All accounts under Primary Officer: **Jj Litchford**, Secondary: **Paul Morris**:
- LEIMER DOMINIQUE (appears twice)
- JEFFREY EPSTEIN (appears multiple times)
- CHRISTOPHER A. BOIES
- **LEON D. BLACK** (appears twice)
- TODD & KAREN WANEK JTWRO
- SOUTHERN TRUST COMPANY
- SOUTHERN FINANCIAL LLC
- NEPTUNE, LLC
- HYPERION AIR, LLC
- JEGE, INC
- PLAN D, LLC
- JEGE, LLC
- THE 2007 JEFFREY E. EPSTEIN [TRUST]
- DARREN K. INDYKE PLLC

## IV. WHAT THE MONEY WAS INVESTED IN

### A. Bloomberg Terminal Screenshots (EFTA01446xxx-01458xxx Range)

The DB files contain dozens of Bloomberg terminal screenshots of bond instruments being researched or traded:

1. **Citigroup Inc 5.95% Perpetual Jr Subordinated Notes** (Variable, Fix-to-Float) - Multiple screenshots ([EFTA01458029](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01458029.pdf), [EFTA01367704](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01367704.pdf), [EFTA01458031](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01458031.pdf)) - Amount Issued: USD 1,250,000,000 (M)

2. **MBONO 7.34% 11/13/42** (Mexican Government Bond) - Yield analysis visible ([EFTA01446683](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01446683.pdf))

3. **Hellenic Republic Floating Rate Notes** (Greek sovereign debt) - 1.619% coupon, EUR 5.187B issued ([EFTA01450741](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01450741.pdf))

4. **Banco Espirito Santo SA 7.125% Subordinated Notes** - EUR 750M issued, Maturity 11/28/2023 ([EFTA01454551](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01454551.pdf))

5. **Federative Republic of Brazil CDS** via Southern Financial LLC - USD 10mm notional, 205bps spread ([EFTA01368602](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01368602.pdf))

6. **CROCI US Dividends TR vs S&P 500 INDEX** analysis ([EFTA01447120](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01447120.pdf) and variants)

7. **US Generic Govt 10 Year Yield** charts ([EFTA01454252](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01454252.pdf))

**Pattern:** The portfolio was heavily weighted toward fixed-income instruments: sovereign bonds (Mexico, Greece, Brazil), corporate subordinated debt (Citigroup, Banco Espirito Santo), and yield curve positions. This is a sophisticated but conventional bond portfolio -- NOT the kind of portfolio that generates $500M from scratch.

### B. Credit Default Swaps via Southern Financial LLC

> *"Reference: FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL / Counterparty: SOUTHERN FINANCIAL LLC / Notional: USD 10mm / Effective date: 14-Jan-2015 / Maturity date: 20-Mar-2020 / Deal rate: 100 / Price: 95.01670000 / Principal: 498,330.00"*
> -- [EFTA01368602](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01368602.pdf)

Southern Financial LLC was used as the counterparty name for CDS trades on Brazilian sovereign debt. This indicates Epstein's entities were trading credit derivatives through DB -- not managing other people's money.

### C. Estimated Annual Investment Income

Based on the "Estimated Annual Income" figures from DB portfolio statements:
- The $103-132M account generated ~$3.2M-$6.4M/year
- The $102-117M account generated ~$2.5M-$5.7M/year

**Total estimated annual investment income across all visible DB accounts: $8M-$15M/year**

This is consistent with coupon and interest payments on a $300M+ fixed-income portfolio at average yields of 3-5%. It does NOT explain how $300M+ was accumulated in the first place.

---

## V. THE WEXNER CONNECTION -- THE ONLY NAMED SOURCE

### A. DOJ Summary Documents ([EFTA01656152](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01656152.pdf)/01656173/01656198/01660622)

Multiple copies of the same FBI/DOJ summary document state repeatedly:

> *"[He] earned his money from Wexner."*

This phrase appears on page 17 of at least four separate EFTA documents in the context of the "PROMINENT NAMES" section.

### B. The $46 Million Charitable Donation

> *"Subject: CNBC; Jeffrey Epstein used $46 million charitable donation to keep alive his ties with billionaire Les Wexner"*
> -- [EFTA00026723](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00026723.pdf)

### C. Wexner Lawsuit Decision

> *"later told me that they had decided not to sue Wexner because he was..."*
> -- [EFTA01682081](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01682081.pdf)

### D. L Brands / Victoria's Secret Connection

> *"an investment opportunity in September 2005 to Ed Razek, an L Brands executive who helps select Victoria's Secret models. Epstein invited the two men to the Manhattan mansion and when he and Razek showed up, Mook said, they were welcomed by young women who..."*
> -- [EFTA00014526](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00014526.pdf)

### Analysis:
Wexner is the ONLY billionaire identified in these documents as a source of Epstein's wealth. However:
- No specific transfer amount from Wexner TO Epstein is documented in the financial records
- The $46M charitable donation went FROM Epstein (or an entity) TO maintain the relationship -- suggesting Epstein had independent wealth by that point
- No Power of Attorney document over Wexner's finances was found in this database (EFTA01480247 is actually Epstein granting Maxwell POA over his own JPMorgan accounts, not a Wexner-Epstein POA)

---

## VI. LEON BLACK -- THE CO-MANAGED CLIENT

### A. Banking Relationship

Leon D. Black had his personal accounts at Deutsche Bank under the SAME relationship managers as Epstein:
- Both listed under Jj Litchford (Primary) / Paul Morris (Secondary)
- Both later under Morris/Oldfield
- Black appears on at least THREE separate DB account management lists alongside Epstein entities

### B. Allegations in DOJ Summary

The PROMINENT NAMES document (multiple EFTAs) states regarding Leon Black:
> *"[Victim] stated [she was instructed to give] a massage while Black... another female gave... her perform oral sex... Black's penis size."*
> *"[Victim] stated... times and sex traffick... Black threatened to [destroy her]... connections with the [powerful]"*

### C. Apollo Management Connection

> *"Melanie Spinella | Apollo Management / Executive Assistant to Leon D. Black"*
> -- [EFTA01773654](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01773654.pdf)

### D. Significance

Leon Black publicly acknowledged paying Epstein $158M in "advisory fees" between 2012-2017 (per public reporting). This is NOT directly documented in the hidden text of these files, but his co-management at DB with Epstein is forensically confirmed by the banker assignment records. The question of whether Black's payments TO Epstein were genuine advisory fees or something else remains open.

---

## VII. THE WIRE TRANSFER TRAIL

### A. Deutsche Bank Internal Wires

The DB files contain extensive wire-related communications:

1. **"Epstein Wire deposit"** -- Multiple emails between DB officers, particularly involving Geoffroy de Calbiac (Paris office, reference 582) and DB compliance
   - [EFTA01380458](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01380458.pdf): "TR: Epstein Wire deposit"
   - [EFTA01388894](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01388894.pdf): "Re: Epstein Wire deposit"
   - [EFTA01387535](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01387535.pdf): "RE: Wire deposit"

2. **"HELP TO STOP WIRE FROM LSJE"** -- Multiple urgent emails involving Richard Kahn and Bradley Gillin
   - [EFTA01426305](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01426305.pdf): "HELP TO STOP WIRE FROM LSJE T[RUST]"
   - [EFTA01426081](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01426081.pdf): Same
   - [EFTA01417218](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01417218.pdf): Same

   **This suggests DB compliance or officers tried to stop outgoing wires from the LSJE Trust -- indicating internal concern about the transactions.**

3. **"URGENT DEPOSIT PWM RETURN"** -- Account 35269691
   - [EFTA01407986](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01407986.pdf): "**URGENT** DEPOSIT PWM RETURN A/c #"
   - [EFTA01407832](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01407832.pdf): "RE: **URGENT** DEPOSIT PWM RETURN A/c # 35269691 dated 07.06.18"

   **A deposit was RETURNED to account 35269691 -- suggesting a transaction was rejected or reversed.**

4. **"Outgoing Wire Status Change"** -- Multiple status change notifications
5. **"xxx9295 3 wires"** -- Multiple emails about 3 wire transfers on account ending 9295
6. **"$23mn Wire"** -- [EFTA01384079](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01384079.pdf): "Required on $23mn Wire" -- a $23 million wire transfer

### B. Fedwire Transactions from JPMorgan Chase Accounts

The JPM statements show extensive Fedwire activity, predominantly DEBITS (outgoing):

| Transaction | Counterparty | Details |
|---|---|---|
| Fedwire Debit | FirstBank PR/221571473 | A/C: Nautilus Inc |
| Fedwire Debit | FirstBank PR/221571473 | A/C: LSJ, LLC |

| FedWire Credit | Flac Bank USA/21001088 | BAD: Adam Bly |
| Foreign Remittance | Barclays Bank Plc | Fx USD Incoming/Bournemouth |
| ADP Payroll | ADP TX/Fin | Payroll |

### C. Incoming Wire Transfer -- The Lone Identified Source

> *"04/05/16 Incoming Wire Transfer / WIRE FROM E TRUST / 100,000.00"*
> -- [EFTA02731529](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2012/EFTA02731529.pdf), Page 12

**This is the ONLY clearly identified incoming wire transfer with a named source in the entire database.** "E TRUST" sent $100,000. The identity of "E TRUST" is not further specified.

---

## VIII. KYC BREACHES AND COMPLIANCE FAILURES

### A. Deutsche Bank KYC Breach -- Southern Financial LLC

An extensive email chain among DB compliance officers documents KYC (Know Your Customer) breaches:

- **"KYC Breach_SOUTHFINANMD_Southern Financial, LLC_FFT Loca..."** ([EFTA01362996](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01362996.pdf))
- Involved: Akash Malhotra, Shawn Staker, Nina Tona, Pankaj-A Chopra, Mathew Negus, Martin Zeman, Joe Alim, Ian Salters, Alka Gopala, NCA OTC Derivatives team
- Escalation: "ONB 1135648 / LKYCGB 160049 / Southern Financial" ([EFTA01362904](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01362904.pdf))
- "Southern Financial LLC - KYC and credit derivatives/convertible bonds" ([EFTA01362751](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01362751.pdf))

**The KYC breach was specifically linked to Southern Financial LLC's credit derivatives and convertible bond trading activity.** DB's own compliance team flagged that they did not have adequate documentation on the source of funds or beneficial ownership for the entity that was trading CDS on Brazilian sovereign debt with a $10M notional.

### B. Source of Funds Documentation

> *"If the initial deposit is over $500,000... please document source of funds or source [of wealth]"*
> -- [EFTA01269520](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01269520.pdf) (FirstBank PR account opening form)

**No completed source-of-funds documentation has been recovered in this database.**

### C. Portfolio Alert

> *"Cc: PWM US AMLKYC... Subject: RE: portfolio Alert_"*
> -- [EFTA01362066](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01362066.pdf)

Anti-Money Laundering teams at DB were issuing portfolio alerts on the accounts.

## IX. GRATITUDE AMERICA, LTD -- THE CHARITABLE ENTITY

### Account Activity at Deutsche Bank:

**Key Transaction:**
> *"GRATITUDE AMERICA, LTD / 200,000.00 CASH MANGMNT XFER"*
> -- [EFTA01427164](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01427164.pdf)

**A $200,000 cash management transfer was made to Gratitude America Ltd.** The source of funds for Gratitude America is not documented. Its balance fluctuated between $100K and $4.3M -- suggesting it received periodic large infusions and drew them down. No donor records or charitable purpose documents have been recovered.

Additionally:
> *"and Gratitude America Ltd"* appears in [EFTA01374744](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01374744.pdf) in a context suggesting it was listed alongside other Epstein entities in compliance documentation.

## X. THE INCOME QUESTION: MANAGEMENT FEES VS. INVESTMENT INCOME

### A. No Management/Advisory Fees Found

The search for "management fee," "advisory fee," or "consulting" in the hidden text yielded **ZERO results** from financial transaction documents. No invoice, wire confirmation, or bank statement entry describes income from managing other people's money.

### B. Richard Kahn -- "The Manager"

> *"has no relation (Richard Kahn is the manager of this account and sole [authorized...]"*
> -- [EFTA01361504](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01361504.pdf)

> *Multiple emails: "Richard Kahn... management account"*
> -- [EFTA01388183](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01388183.pdf), 01382099, 01378684, 01379284, etc.

Richard Kahn managed Epstein's own accounts -- he is described as the "sole" authorized party. This is not a fund management structure; this is personal wealth management.

### C. What Epstein Actually Earned

Based on all portfolio statements:
- **Annual coupon/interest income: $8M-$15M/year** from a fixed-income portfolio of $300M+
- **No fee income documented**
- **No client payments documented**
- **No advisory revenue documented**

---

## XI. THE CENTRAL ANOMALY: WHERE DID THE MONEY COME FROM?

### A. What We Can Account For

1. **Wexner connection** -- the only named source, per multiple DOJ summaries: "earned his money from Wexner"
2. **$46M charitable donation** -- reversed direction (Epstein TO Wexner's charitable interests)
3. **Investment returns** -- $8-15M/year on existing capital
4. **One incoming wire** -- $100K from "E TRUST" (04/05/16)

### B. What We Cannot Account For

1. **The original $300-500M+ in capital** -- No transfer, no gift documentation, no inheritance record, no business sale, no fund return
2. **Any client** -- Not a single client of Epstein's financial advisory/management business is identified in any financial transaction record
3. **Any management fee** -- Zero documented fee income
4. **Any advisory fee** -- Zero documented advisory income
5. **The mechanism by which Wexner's money became Epstein's money** -- No Power of Attorney, no gift letter, no asset transfer documentation recovered

### C. The $9.2M Credit With No Debits

> *"Total Credits: $9,200,000.00 / Total Debits: $0.00"*
> -- [EFTA01504498](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01504498.pdf)

A single bank statement period shows $9.2 million in credits and zero debits. The source of the $9.2M is not identified in the recovered text.

### D. The Money Flow Pattern

The actual pattern visible in the documents is:
1. **Large capital pools** sit in DB portfolio accounts earning coupon income
2. **Wire transfers go OUT** -- to shell entities, to FirstBank PR, to payees including law firms, jet interiors, builders
3. **Internal cash management transfers** move money between the shell entities
4. **No identifiable external source feeds IN** new capital

---

## XII. PERSONS AND ENTITIES OF INTEREST

### Financial Gatekeepers
- **Richard Kahn** -- Account manager, sole authorized party, "management account" administrator
- **Darren K. Indyke** -- Attorney, trustee (PLLC and Attorney Trust Account), authorized wire initiator
- **Jj Litchford** -- Deutsche Bank Primary Account Officer for ALL Epstein accounts AND Leon Black accounts
- **Paul Morris** -- Deutsche Bank Secondary Account Officer, same portfolio
- **Stewart Oldfield** -- Later DB banker, paired with Morris
- **Bradley Gillin** -- DB wire operations, multiple wire-related emails
- **Liam Osullivan** -- DB officer, wire requests and credit derivatives
- **Davide-A Sferrazza** -- DB officer, credit derivatives
- **Geoffroy de Calbiac** -- DB Paris office (wire deposit processing for Epstein)

### Named Financial Connections
- **Leslie Wexner** -- Only named source of wealth
- **Leon D. Black** -- Co-managed accounts at DB under same officers; public reports of $158M in payments to Epstein
- **Christopher A. Boies** -- DB account under same officers (likely related to David Boies, Esq.)
- **Todd & Karen Wanek** -- DB accounts under same officers (billionaire Ashley Furniture family)
- **Dominique Leimer** -- DB accounts under same officers (appears twice)
- **Mark F. Dzialga** -- DB accounts under same officers

## XIII. CONCLUSIONS

### Finding 1: No Legitimate Source for $500M+ Identified
In 1,808,915 redactions and 39,588 reconstructed pages of DOJ documents, there is no documentation of any legitimate business activity, client relationship, advisory engagement, management fee, carried interest, or fund return that explains the accumulation of $500M+ in wealth. The ONLY named source is Leslie Wexner, and even that connection lacks documented transfer mechanics in these files.

### Finding 2: The Wealth Was Real But Its Origin Was Hidden
The portfolio statements are genuine. The balances are consistent across multiple reporting periods. The investment income is mathematically correct for the yields shown. The instruments held (sovereign bonds, corporate sub-debt, CDS) are real. But the capital that purchased these instruments has no traceable origin in these records.

### Finding 3: Deutsche Bank's Own Compliance Flagged the Problem
DB's AML/KYC teams identified breaches related to Southern Financial LLC's trading activity and issued portfolio alerts. The fact that compliance was escalating internally suggests DB itself could not adequately document the source of funds -- the same problem we face in this analysis.

### Finding 4: The Shell Entity Structure Is Consistent With Money Laundering
The use of 15+ entities (Southern Trust, Southern Financial, Haze Trust, Butterfly Trust, Gratitude America, Zorro Management, LSJE LLC, JEGE LLC, NES LLC, Neptune LLC, Hyperion Air LLC, Plan D LLC, HBRK Associates, etc.) -- all under the same two bank officers, all receiving internal cash management transfers -- is structurally consistent with layering, a classic money laundering technique. The entities have no apparent independent business purpose visible in these records.

### Finding 5: The Money Flowed OUT, Not IN
Wire transfer records overwhelmingly show outbound Fedwire debits, payments to law firms, aircraft companies, construction firms, and PR-based entities. The flow direction is: Epstein portfolio accounts --> shell entities --> operational spending. The reverse flow -- who funded the portfolio accounts -- is absent.

### Finding 6: The Witness Tampering Wires Suggest Consciousness of Guilt About Financial Relationships
Epstein's $100K and $250K wires to NPA co-conspirators, days after the NPA was published, suggest he was paying to maintain silence about the very relationships this report attempts to trace. The financial relationships he was protecting are likely the ones that would explain the source of wealth.

## XIV. UNANSWERED QUESTIONS

1. What was the specific mechanism by which Wexner's wealth became Epstein's? POA? Gift? Theft?
   - **DS9 ANSWER (Revisit):** The DOJ itself assessed that Wexner's POA enabled Epstein to misappropriate $46M+ which became "the seed money" for his fortune. Multiple copies of a DOJ psychological assessment state: "Leslie Wexner, Mr. Epstein's sole client at J. Epstein and Company, granted him power of attorney over his affairs. Despite also being identified as Mr. Wexner's mentee, Mr. Epstein was again accused of misappropriating funds -- more than 46 million dollars. These large sums are believed to be the seed money Mr. Epstein used to establish his considerable fortune." ([EFTA00105651](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00105651.pdf), [EFTA00121398](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00121398.pdf), [EFTA00123213](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00123213.pdf), [EFTA00040941](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00040941.pdf), [EFTA00135591](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00135591.pdf), DS9)

2. What did Leon Black's $158M in reported payments to Epstein actually purchase?
   - **DS11 ANSWER (Revisit):** Epstein's own emails show he was Black's tax architect, claiming "$600 million in after tax savings." A four-page draft letter ([EFTA02475850](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02475850.pdf), DS11) marked "Leon DO NOT SEND" reveals Epstein expected $50-60M in fees. Brad Karp (Chairman of Paul Weiss) arbitrated a fee dispute settling at $20M. An email to Melanie Spinella at Apollo ([EFTA02475493](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02475493.pdf), DS11) shows a payment schedule including $10M to Gratitude America and "600 savings 225 million owed. - 50 credit, 175 owed" -- suggesting Black owed $175M based on the $600M in tax savings.

3. Who is the "E Trust" that wired $100,000 on 04/05/16? (UNANSWERED)

4. What was the source of the $9.2M single-period credit with no corresponding debits?
   - **PARTIAL DS11 ANSWER (Revisit):** The June 2013 valuation ([EFTA02678941](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02678941.pdf)) shows "Jeepers" holding $28M in cash -- large periodic movements between entities were routine. The $9.2M could be an inter-entity transfer from Jeepers or another entity in the constellation.

5. Why did Deutsche Bank accept $300M+ in assets without completed source-of-funds documentation? (UNANSWERED)

6. What triggered the "HELP TO STOP WIRE FROM LSJE" urgent emails? (UNANSWERED)

7. What was the $23M wire that required special documentation?
   - **DS11 ANSWER (Revisit):** It was $23.3M in collateral for an oil options trade -- 250K barrels at $93.5 strike, placed through JPMorgan by Paul Barrett: "25pct x 93.5 strike x 1million. So 23.3mm usd collateral." ([EFTA02720340](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02720340.pdf)/[EFTA02720774](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02720774.pdf), DS11)

8. Why were Epstein's personal accounts and Leon Black's personal accounts managed by the identical pair of DB officers? (UNANSWERED -- but Exhibit A from [EFTA00080250](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00080250.pdf) now documents the complete $156M+ payment chain)

## ADDENDUM: DS9/DS11 REVISIT FINDINGS (2026-02-12)

### Precise Entity Balances (October 31, 2015)

Richard Kahn email ([EFTA02671293](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02671293.pdf)/[EFTA02481016](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02481016.pdf), DS11) provides exact balances: Southern Trust $82,500,000 / Haze Trust $47,375,000 / Southern Financial LLC $29,250,000. Total of top 3 entities alone: $159,125,000. Epstein responded "stc" directing a $20M transfer from Southern Trust to "erika escrow account" (Erika Kellerhals, USVI attorney).

### June 2013 Complete Entity Valuation ($319.5M)

[EFTA02678941](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02678941.pdf) (DS11): Comprehensive "JEE and Related Entities" valuation as of 6/30/13 shows total cash of $74,241,740 across 6 entities plus JPMorgan trading accounts ($96.6M across SFL/Haze/STC), marketable securities ($11.5M "Jerry"), partnership investments ($105.3M including Tudor Futures $13.6M, Highbridge Capital $19.1M, Apollo, Bear Stearns ABS), and "Settlements Receivable - DSZ" ($33.5M, unidentified). Reconciliation value: $319,455,302.

### Paul Barrett: The Dedicated Portfolio Manager

[EFTA02619039](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02619039.pdf) (DS11): "The only reason I left JPM was that we agreed to a two year deal. I walked away from a great career where I was making $1.5MM a year, left $1.8MM worth of JPM stock on the table." Barrett managed Epstein's fixed-income portfolio at $300K+/year through Alpha Group Capital LLC. The $23M wire (original Unanswered Question #7) was $23.3M collateral for an oil options trade Barrett placed ([EFTA02720340](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02720340.pdf)). Barrett also secured Twitter IPO allocation (1,500 shares at $26, [EFTA02577080](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02577080.pdf)) and later offered SpaceX pre-IPO access through Deutsche Bank ([EFTA02584733](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02584733.pdf)).

### JPM-to-Deutsche Bank Asset Transfer (February 2014)

[EFTA02518675](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02518675.pdf) (DS11): "All positions at JPM were finally closed. JPM will wire today the remaining cash balances to Deutche Bank: 1) Southern Financial -- $10,397,100. 2) Southern Trust (Laurie Cameron) -- $911,808 remaining balance." A $50M line of credit existed at JPM as early as 2010 ([EFTA02416085](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02416085.pdf)).

### LGT Bank Liechtenstein (March 2019)

Four months before arrest, Epstein was actively establishing an offshore banking relationship with LGT Bank Liechtenstein, with explicit instructions to conceal his identity: "tell stewart wed appreciate him saying nothing more that the owner of haze trust has had more than 50 million dollars with us. no more no less no names or details" ([EFTA02637930](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02637930.pdf)). The contact entity was "Khan Stiftung, Ausstrasse 56, FL-9490 Vaduz, Liechtenstein." Stewart Oldfield refused to provide the reference ([EFTA02637471](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02637471.pdf)).

### Alfa Bank (Russia) Wire Transfers (January-February 2019)

LSJE LLC wired $700 to Alfa Bank on 1/31/2019 ([EFTA02627228](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02627228.pdf)). The wire was held up because "intermediary US bank is required for USD wires to Alfa Bank" ([EFTA02629196](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02629196.pdf)). Despite the small amount, the existence of an Alfa Bank relationship is a previously undocumented international banking connection.

### The $20M "Erika Escrow" Transfer (October-November 2015)

$23M total ($20M + $3M) transferred to Erika Kellerhals's escrow account in late 2015 ([EFTA02671293](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02671293.pdf)). Purpose unspecified. Given Kellerhals's role as USVI legal counsel, this could relate to Great St. James Island acquisition, trust restructuring, or legal defense reserves.

### Gratitude America: $30K to NYT Reporter

[EFTA02640495](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02640495.pdf) (DS11): Epstein directed "$30k from gratitude america" to Landon Thomas Jr. of the New York Times, who covered Epstein and finance. Thomas asked: "What was the name again of the name it will come under?" Using a 501(c)(3) to pay a journalist covering the subject raises journalistic ethics and potentially legal concerns.

### Additional Financial Personnel Identified

DS11 identifies a larger support network than the original report documented: Harry Beller (cash management, JPM liaison), Tazia Smith (DB Key Client Partners), Vahe Stepanian (DB equity), Jeanne Brennan (CPA, payroll), Bella Klein (wire execution), Daphne Wallace (USVI operations), Cecile de Jongh (FTC USVI), Ada Clapp (Black tax advisor), Brad Wechsler (Elysium/Black family office), Richard Joslin, Alan Dlugash/Halperin (tax partner), Andrew Atlas (Morgan Stanley), Ted Serure (JPMorgan), and Vincent Orner (JPM daily MTM).
